I believe in the entrepreneurial spirit and the market forces of consumer adoption to push innovation forward, but I also believe that advancing A.I. is a moral imperative due to the host of planetary-level challenges that humans have thus far failed to sufficiently address. Therefore, I believe it is incumbent on us to use A.I. to expand human abilities to solve our most pressing problems \u2014 from climate change and disease eradication to expanding access to opportunity. And so, I see supporting the continued development and adoption of A.I. as a goal in itself. This moral imperative applies on cascading levels. A.I. is a moral good for the world, as it is essential to solving our key problems. A.I. is a moral good for society, as it enables us to architect a more robust scaffolding for our lives that better embodies our humanist values."}

A.I. is the defining technology of our lifetime \u2014 and probably any lifetime. In just a few years, we\u2019ve already witnessed three generations of A.I. First came predictive models that analyze data. Next came generative A.I., driven by deep-learning models like ChatGPT. Now, we are experiencing a third wave \u2014 one defined by intelligent agents that can autonomously handle complex tasks. These agents have the potential to augment human capabilities in ways previously unimaginable. Agentforce, Salesforce\u2019s suite of A.I. agents, is leading this third wave. Agentforce is designed to allow companies to scale their work force dramatically, leveraging A.I. agents to tackle routine tasks and even make decisions.

This capability could boost a company\u2019s productivity and allow employees to focus on higher-value work, fostering innovation, creativity and customer relationships. Agentforce\u2019s goal is to augment every employee, deepen customer relations and increase growth and profit margins. This collaboration between humans and A.I. agents, which combines human creativity and critical thinking with A.I.\u2019s precision and scalability, will form the cornerstone of the future workplace. At Salesforce, we envision deploying more than 1 billion A.I. agents for our customers by the end of 2025. The arrival of A.I. agents is an extraordinary moment for the global economy.

And we should have regulatory frameworks that protect human rights and security while encouraging innovation. We also need to invest more in training younger generations for the jobs of tomorrow, where creativity and critical thinking \u2014 uniquely human traits \u2014 will be more important than ever. The transformative potential of A.I. agents is immense, but with this potential comes the responsibility to ensure that this technology benefits everyone.

Marc Benioff is the chief executive officer of Salesforce. Richard Baldwin: A.I. Can Level the Employment Playing Field I have recently come to understand that A.I. will unleash a global talent wave thanks to its ability to bridge linguistic, skill and cultural gaps. This unexpected insight came to me in phases, and was prompted by my responsibilities teaching at IMD Business School. Standing before executives from a dozen countries, I asked ChatGPT to write a two-minute welcome speech for new employees. The speech was distinctly American, prompting one participant to ask if ChatGPT had detected my accent. Having never considered that, I asked the app to tailor the speech for British, Irish, Kenyan, Indian and South African new hires. Out popped five culturally resonant speeches. As it turns out, ChatGPT is a cultural polyglot. That was my first \u201caha\u201d moment. I realized that A.I. can help bridge cultural gaps.

The next came while presenting research on generative A.I. usage by consultants from Boston Consulting Group. The research uncovered a striking result: the quality and timeliness of work by all consultants improved with the use of generative A.I., but the biggest gains were made by consultants with less experience. This \u201cleveling-up\u201d effect has been widely confirmed. In hindsight, leveling up seems inevitable. Generative A.I. is trained on big data, but uses techniques to prioritize high-quality work, so it encapsulates the expertise of the best professionals. Using A.I. tools can help make the work of junior consultants closer to that of more experienced ones. Top-ranked consultants still have more to offer clients than their less-experienced colleagues, but A.I. helps make higher-level work accessible to clients with less to spend. That was my second lightbulb moment. The third came from global role-playing. Imagine workers in low-wage countries cast in the role of the low-skilled consultants in the Boston Consulting Group study.

Now, with the help of A.I., leveling up skills makes foreign teleworkers more interchangeable with Americans. The upshot is clear: U.S. firms can more easily substitute Americans with A.I.-enhanced talent living in places where $10 an hour affords a middle-class lifestyle. This final realization came while discussing simultaneous speech translation and how it could eliminate language barriers. Imagine a Zoom meeting between Spanish-speaking Ricardo and -speaking Emily. With A.I.-driven simultaneous speech translation, Emily hears while Ricardo speaks Spanish \u2014 no reading subtitles, no delays \u2014 Ricardo speaks Spanish, Emily hears , and vice versa. This series of experiences led to my unexpected epiphany. A.I. will level up skills, break down language barriers and smooth out cultural differences, thus unlocking the full potential of office and professional workers around the globe. At first glance, that sounds like A.I. could result in the offshoring of American office jobs the same way that globalization offshored U.S. factory jobs. I don\u2019t think it will.

Moreover, the new corridors for services will flow both ways. We\u2019ll see more foreign teleworkers in U.S. offices and more U.S. teleworkers in foreign offices. I\u2019m optimistic that incomes will rise rather than fall, as A.I. boosts skills worldwide. However, this outcome depends on Americans embracing A.I.

Its profound impacts are set to permeate every facet of the economy and society, ushering in a series of transformative changes. I see several important ways A.I. will reshape the global economy in the years ahead. First, A.I. is driving the restructuring of global value chains, leading to the relocation of resources for enhanced efficiency. This restructuring includes the resurgence of manufacturing in North America and Europe and the automation of labor-intensive services like accounting, legal support and customer service. A.I. optimizes supply chain visibility, predicts demand fluctuations and streamlines logistics, promoting bespoke services and precision marketing to cater to individualized consumer needs efficiently. A.I. also is instigating a profound transformation of the global labor market. While automation may displace certain jobs that involve repetitive tasks, it also creates a demand for new roles such as A.I. trainers, data scientists and machine learning engineers. It creates new professions that involve the use of A.I. to do traditional jobs, such as A.I.-based artists.

The \u201970s are when economic inequality really begins rising, when the environmental movement takes off, when a huge amount of legislation is passed in response to the harms of all the building and growth that had happened since the New Deal. But there\u2019s this tendency to look at the places that legislation goes too far and to say, well, if we hadn\u2019t made all these dumb mistakes, everything would be great. We\u2019d be richer.

Things change in the U.S. economy on any number of charts. You begin to see something happen to the line. What are some of those changes? JIM PETHOKOUKIS: The most obvious change, at least especially from an economics point of view, is that the sort of rapid productivity growth that we saw in the previous couple of decades that economists and other experts in the \u201960s thought was going to be a permanent state of affairs slowed down. And other than, really, the late \u201990s or early 2000s, it\u2019s been in that sort of weaker state. And it\u2019s one of the great, still, conundrums for economists.

I mean, economists still, less so now, would have debates about what caused the Great Depression. And to me, this downshift, what I call in my book, \u201cthe great downshift in productivity growth,\u201d is as significant as that because of we\u2019re not where we could be if it hadn\u2019t. EZRA KLEIN: So if it had kept growing since the \u201970s, as it did in the couple decades before, what would the US economy look like? What would the median household income look like? JIM PETHOKOUKIS: Bigger, more, multiples more, and that was the expectation. So instead of having a $25 trillion economy, depending on how you want to slice the numbers, it could be twice as big, it could be three times as big. So I don\u2019t know. I mean, I think conservatively, instead of the median family making $80,000 adjusted for inflation, maybe they make $150,000. I mean, it\u2019s pretty significant. What that economy would look like?

Well, listen, to grow that fast, it would be driven by technological progress. And that\u2019s what people expected in those immediate postwar decades. So all the sort of the kind of classic, retro, Jetsons kind of sci-fi things that people imagined back then, it wasn\u2019t just sort of cartoons and films. Experts, technologists, CEOs, economists all expected that kind of stuff to actually happen. So nuclear power and everything, nuclear reactors from coast to coast. We would probably have, colonies on the moon and Mars. Cures to diseases, which seem like chronic diseases, which we still battle, would be cured. All of that together would be part of this grand future, driven by rapid, technological progress, which drives faster productivity growth, which drives faster economic growth. If there\u2019s one lesson of the pandemic, is, people don\u2019t like suffering and shortages, so we better figure out a different way.

What do you see as the contributors to this slowdown? JIM PETHOKOUKIS: I think, certainly, it was probably multi-causal. One reason I wrote the book, to be honest, is a paper, a paper by an economist named Ray Fair from Yale University who noticed something weird happened around the \u201970s. He wasn\u2019t focused on productivity growth, but he looked at infrastructure spending as a share of total economic spending. And he looked at what was going on with the budget, where we started to begin to run smaller surpluses and run budget deficits around 1970. And he asked the exact same question that you\u2019re asking. So, like, what happened?

You tended to see it more in the United States than in other places. EZRA KLEIN: So what are your theories? JIM PETHOKOUKIS: Listen, I\u2019m not going to create a brand new theory. Was it just that all of the great inventions, the internal combustion engine, electrification of factories, and all those great inventions of the second kind of phase, Industrial Revolution, we had kind of squeezed all the sort of productivity gains out of those, and they weren\u2019t replaced by another wave of great inventions? I mean, that\u2019s a theory. I mean, another theory is just that as we\u2019ve advanced in science technology, it\u2019s just harder to climb that tree of knowledge and come up with more big ideas. And it requires more people and resources. All of that is probably true. But our decisions mattered. And there are things that we did, which hurt. And I hope we can reverse"}

And I hope we can reverse some of those things because that would help. And I think the two, I think, screamingly obvious things that we stopped doing is we stopped spending on science, research, and development, the way we did in the 1960s, and we began to regulate our economy as if regulation would have no impact on innovation. EZRA KLEIN: What\u2019s your causal theory of why we did that? JIM PETHOKOUKIS: I think a lot of that was because of NASA, and we won the space race. And there just wasn\u2019t an interest in continuing that. OK, so that\u2019s sort of the immediate short-term explanation. EZRA KLEIN: So much of that was really just NASA? Because I think of the R&D surge as the Cold War. JIM PETHOKOUKIS: Right. EZRA KLEIN: And the Soviet Union was going strong in the \u201970s. JIM PETHOKOUKIS: Right, Soviet Union was going strong."}

But we had clearly won that space race. And while we\u2019ve continued to spend a lot of money on R&D as a share of the economy, it\u2019s a lot less than what it used to be. That\u2019s not surprising that perhaps there was a shift in priorities. People did begin worrying about budgets back then. And the regulation part to me also sort of isn\u2019t surprising. When countries become wealthier, they tend to care a lot more about the downsides of economic growth. There are books, like \u201cSilent Spring,\u201d and some events, like the Santa Barbara oil spill. We began learning more about the radiation from Hiroshima and worrying about nuclear. So that is not surprising that we started to pass environmental regulation.

EZRA KLEIN: So I\u2019ve been, for my own book, thinking a lot about the \u201970s and looking a lot at the politics of the \u201970s. And from where we sit now, we think of environmentalism as a liberal thing, right? The environmentalists are greens, they\u2019re Democrats. And I ran into this quote that Richard Nixon gives in his 1970 State of the Union that I think gives a good flavor of how different the politics had become. So I want to play that here. ^ARCHIVED RECORDING (RICHARD NIXON)^: The great question of the \u201970s is, shall we surrender to our surroundings, or shall we make our peace with nature and begin to make reparations for the damage we have done to our air, to our land, and to our water?

It is a cause of particular concern to young Americans because they, more than we, will reap the grim consequences of our failure to act on programs which are needed now if we are to prevent disaster later. Clean air, clean water, open spaces \u2014 these should once again be the birthright of every American. If we act now, they can be. We still think of air as free, but clean air is not free, and neither is clean water. The price tag on pollution control is high. Through our years of past carelessness, we incurred a debt to nature.

Is it worth losing a little bit of growth \u2014 maybe \u2014 to deal with that? So, that doesn\u2019t surprise me.

I don\u2019t think they did. I believe they thought that the economy was so strong and that technological progress, the momentum was so tremendous that we could have cleaner air and water and still have everything else. The people who voted for, for instance, the National Environmental Policy Act, most people thought that was just kind of a good mom and pop and baseball and apple pie piece of legislation. Hey, who doesn\u2019t want cleaner water? That\u2019s all what we\u2019re doing here.

This skill can then be applied to your daily life.

And most of what I see coming out of people using them, it\u2019s all riffing on others in this very obvious way. What I like about Herndon\u2019s art is she uses A.I. to become weirder, stranger, more uncanny, more personal. It\u2019s going in the exact opposite direction.

So I started using my voice as a kind of input stream.

So at the time, it was a very different time, especially for audio. A lot of the visual models were developed earlier. But eventually, things got better.

And you\u2019ll hear still from the from the stems that we might play later the vocal quality, the sound quality from 2017, 2018. To me, it sounded like the really early recordings that you can find on YouTube. I think it\u2019s like the earliest audio recording. It sounds really scratchy and super low fidelity. That\u2019s what the audio sounded like back in the day. And so it was this real issue of trying to get the high fidelity recordings that I was doing with my ensemble in the studio to live in the same universe as this really scratchy, low-fi audio that I was generating through Spawn. EZRA KLEIN: Well, why don\u2019t we play a bit of that? Because you kindly shared the stems for the song \u201cSwim.\u201d And maybe we should start here by playing the ensemble, the sort of chorus you brought together to sing for the album.

[VOCALIZATION] So that\u2019s really beautiful and really human. And now on the other side, I want to play the Spawn track on its own. [MUSIC PLAYING] What am I hearing when I hear that somewhat nightmarish Spawn there? HOLLY HERNDON: So Spawn was trained on the voices of the ensemble. And so back then, we couldn\u2019t deal with polyphony, which means one \u2014 more than one note at a time. So what we had to do was break each line into an individual line, and then we would feed that line to Spawn, who would then sing it back through the voice of our ensemble. And I think we were feeding it through with a either a voice synthesizer or a piano. I can\u2019t remember. It\u2019s been so long. But so we basically use this idea, which is called timbre transfer. So that\u2019s where the computer learns the logic of one sound and kind of superimposes that onto the performance of another."}

We had the ensemble sing a variety of phrases. We trained Spawn on their voices. And then we did a timbre transfer. We fed her the line that we wanted her to sing. And then she sang it back to us. EZRA KLEIN: And I think hearing that, one question you could have is, well, what do you need Spawn for? Why not just have a human being sing into a talk box or use a synthesizer or ableton? We can make people\u2019s voices sound strange already, auto-tune. What is the value of Spawn here? HOLLY HERNDON: I think overall spawn has a unique timbral quality that I actually really love because it really is a snapshot in time. It doesn\u2019t sound like that anymore. It sounds really clean and, yeah, really high fidelity. But at that period of time,"}

But at that period of time, it\u2019s I almost have this like romanticism around that, almost like a vinyl hiss or a pop for that very particular period of time in machine learning research. But also, I felt like I really needed to be making my own models and dealing with the subject directly in order to have a really informed opinion about it. And I\u2019m really glad that I made that decision, because it\u2019s informed so much of the work that I do today. Just even the very basic understanding that that a model\u2019s output is so tied to the training data, the input, I don\u2019t know that I would have come to the profundity of that had I not been training my own models.

EZRA KLEIN: We\u2019re going to come back to the profundity of that, because I actually think it\u2019s really important. But I wanted to do two things before we do. One is to play a bit of the full song, \u201cSwim,\u201d so people can hear where this ended up. [HOLLY HERNDON, \u201cSWIM\u201d] And so then I want to play something you just released more recently using \u2014 I don\u2019t know if you\u2019d call this an updated Spawn, but we\u2019re calling Holly+, which is this much more modern voice model trained on your voice that you had covered Dolly Parton\u2019s Jolene. [HOLLY HERNDON, \u201cJOLENE\u201d] EZRA KLEIN: So obviously the unearthly quality is gone. What am I hearing? Who \u2014 what is singing? HOLLY HERNDON: So that is a voice model trained on my voice.

And Holly Plus was born. And as you can hear, it\u2019s leaps and bounds better, more high \u2014 higher fidelity than little Spawn. So basically, that version of Holly+, there are multiple versions. There\u2019s a version that can be performed in real time, but this particular version is a score-reading piece of software. So I basically just write out a score with the text written out in phonemes. And then the software spits out basically pitch-perfect performance of that song. And of course, it helps to have Ryan Norris playing a beautiful human guitar accompaniment. EZRA KLEIN: That\u2019s a use case that I\u2019m fascinated by, that I imagine will become more and more common in the future, which is a model trained on a person that one can sort of almost autonomously create as if it were that person.

And do you see it as an extension of what you can do? Or do you see it as a kind of partner you can collaborate with? Or do you see it as just some version of you that makes you scale because you can\u2019t take commissions to sing from everybody out in the public, but they can all go to Holly Plus and get it to sing on their behalf? Like, what is your relationship with this nascent other you, or at least other voice of you, that now exists in the world?

So for me to make a model of my voice that felt like the natural next step in an already very kind of highly-mediated process with my voice, I don\u2019t expect everyone to have that relationship. I don\u2019t really see the Holly+ voice as something that replaces me in any way. It\u2019s something that I have fun playing with. I can attempt to perform things that I wouldn\u2019t normally be able to. You know, I did a performance with Maria Arnal in Barcelona, and, I mean, that music is so difficult to perform.

And it didn\u2019t confuse me to think, OK, I can do that now. It was more just fun to hear myself do something that I know that I couldn\u2019t do alone acoustically. So I guess for me, it\u2019s maybe like an extension or an augmentation of my own self. EZRA KLEIN: So what did Holly+ add to that cover of Jolene? I mean, you could have just sung a few tracks of harmony and added them above the melody. So what does A.I. mean to you in it specifically? HOLLY HERNDON: Well, I think that one is perhaps a little personal because growing up in east Tennessee, Dolly Parton was kind of the patron saint of that region.

And the kind of music that I usually perform has very heavily processed vocals and is usually, it\u2019s a bit more abstract than a Dolly Parton song. So it was almost like I wouldn\u2019t afford myself that or allow myself that, but I would allow Holly+ to do it, because there was this kind of level of removal. It\u2019s almost like Holly+ can perform things that I would be too bashful to perform myself. EZRA KLEIN: Oh, that\u2019s really interesting, the idea that having another version of yourself out there could give you license to try things you wouldn\u2019t otherwise try. HOLLY HERNDON: Yeah, like Jolene. I mean, I love Jolene as a project, but it doesn\u2019t have the same ghostliness and quality as the music on \u201cPROTO,\u201d which is why I didn\u2019t release it as an album, you know.

I spent a bunch of time recently creating sort of A.I. friends and therapists. And, you\u2019re trying to understand, like, the relational A.I.s that you can build now. And on the one hand, I was amazed at technically how good a lot of them were. At the same time, I find I never end up coming back. I find it very hard to make the habit sticky or the relationship sticky. When I sit with my friend or my partner, the fact that they are choosing to be there with me is separate from the things that they are saying. And an experience I\u2019m having with a lot of A.I. projects is that the output is pretty good, right? Holly+ sings really well.

Or the therapist friend I made on Kindroid texts in a way that if you had just shown me the text, I would not know it\u2019s not a human being. But the absence of there being the meaning of it that another person brings, the fact that I know it\u2019s Holly+, like, it\u2019s a cool project, but I\u2019m not going to keep listening to it. The fact that I know the Kindroid can\u2019t not show up to talk to me, that that\u2019s a relationship I control totally. It robs the interaction of meaning in a way that makes it hard for me to keep coming back to it. And so somebody who works a lot with the question of meaning and sees a lot of these A.I. efforts happening, how do you think about what imbues them with meaning, and in what cases they end up feeling hollow?

I was trying to show all of the kind of human relationships and the human singing that goes into training these models. That\u2019s something I was really trying to get to with that album is, you know, allowing the some of the things that the computer can do, you know, some of the coordination that it can do is remarkable.

[MUSIC PLAYING] EZRA KLEIN: I\u2019ve heard you say that with A.I., it\u2019s the model that\u2019s the art, not necessarily the output of the model. HOLLY HERNDON: Yeah, that\u2019s one thing that we\u2019re exploring quite a bit. So one of the potentials around machine learning is that you\u2019re not limited to just a single output. You can create a model of whether that\u2019s my own singing voice or whether that\u2019s my own image or likeness, and you can allow other people to explore the logic of that model"}

You can create a model of whether that\u2019s my own singing voice or whether that\u2019s my own image or likeness, and you can allow other people to explore the logic of that model and to prompt through your world. So it\u2019s almost kind of like inviting people into your subjectivity, or inviting someone into your video, the video game of your art. So I think it has a lot of potential to be interesting in a kind of collaborative way with your audience. One term that we\u2019re often using is \u201cprotocol art,\u201d basically understanding that any work that\u2019s made is a kind of seed for infinite generations. So we\u2019re trying to lean into that. So, for example, if we make a sculpture, which we did a project called \u201cReady Weight,\u201d we also make it available as a package with an embedding and a Lora and all the kind of tools that anyone would need to be able to explore that sculpture in latent space.

So that\u2019s the example of protocol art, where really, it becomes a collaborative experience between myself and the people who are engaging with my work. And in a way, art\u2019s kind of always a little bit like that. It\u2019s a conversation between the work that you\u2019re making and the viewer or the recipient, but that becomes a little bit more complicated and fun, I think, in an A.I. world. EZRA KLEIN: You wrote something in 2018 that I think is worth exploring where you said that A.I. is a deceptive, over-abused term. \u201cCollective intelligence\u201d is more useful. Why? HOLLY HERNDON: Because I really do see it as a kind of aggregate human intelligence. It\u2019s trained on all of us.

Jonathan Greenblatt: C.E.O. and national director, the Anti-Defamation League Groundbreaker Topic: The Rise (and Hopefully Fall) of Antisemitism in the 2020s How can corporations be a more effective partner in combating antisemitism? Corporate leadership is crucial in combating hate and antisemitism across society. Many corporations have signed ADLs Workplace Pledge, but amid an unprecedented increase in antisemitism after Oct. 7, many more need to step up. With antisemitism surging, all companies must take meaningful action to protect Jewish employees and customers. This includes using their bully pulpits to strongly and forcefully condemn antisemitism. And to ensure workplaces remain safe and welcoming for Jewish employees, employers should also offer educational programs, update religious accommodations and support Jewish employee resource groups. Anything less is unacceptable. Chris Hadfield:"}

Chris Hadfield: Astronaut, commander of the International Space Station, combat fighter/test pilot and author Groundbreaker Topic: The Global Space Race, the Mission to the Moon and Beyond to Mars How is returning to the moon consequential in attaining the exploration of Mars? In real estate, the three main things to consider are location, location and location. And often, on Earth, people want sunny waterfront. As we now transition from exploration to settlement on the moon, its the same. There is eternal solar power and local water available only in select locations near the poles. China has clearly stated its goal to have people there by 2030, and the smooth landing spots are rare.

Jonathan Haidt: Author and the Thomas Cooley Professor of Ethical Leadership at New York Universitys Stern School of Business Groundbreaker Topic: The Impacts and Implications of a Phone-Based Childhood on Society, Democracy and the Economy What is the best motivation parents can use to get children off their phones? Teens and preteens are intensely focused on what their peers think of them. They are very afraid of being cut off, being the only one without a phone or an Instagram account. So make sure they are not the only one. Coordinate with the parents of your childs friends. They probably share your concerns. If you have not given your child a smartphone yet, delaying that fateful day until the start of high school is the best single thing you can do. If you already have given a smartphone, set clear boundaries, such as all screens out of the bedroom by 9:30 p.m., no phones at the table and, ideally, no smartphone"}

Better, worse, the same? We are anticipating a market in 2025 thats largely flat to 2024 appetite -- so, more of the same. An improved interest rate environment feels like it should add wind to everyones backs but I dont feel optimistic that this will translate quickly to an uptick in content spending versus what we are seeing in 2024.

Sherrilyn Ifill: President and director-counsel emeritus, the N.A.A.C.P. Legal Defense Fund Groundbreaker Topic: Corporate Citizens as Critical Institutions of a Healthy Democracy What are the obligations you believe a company owes to the democracy in which it exists? Democracy is not the same as partisan politics. Far too many corporate leaders confuse the two. Whatever the partisan interests of individual corporate leaders, clients or consumers, corporations have an obligation to support the infrastructure that maintains the health of our democracy. This means support for core values: the rule of law, free and fair elections, the peaceful transfer of power, equal justice, and protection against state-sanctioned seizures and violence against citizens.

Where are you directing your efforts today? While weve made incredible progress in total college enrollment, we have to look at what fields and demographics are not captured by these figures.

David Miliband: President and C.E.O., the International Rescue Committee Groundbreaker Topic: Previewing the International Rescue Committees 2025 Emergency Watchlist and How Tech Is Innovating to Help the Worlds Most Vulnerable What are the most promising areas of humanitarian response where A.I. innovations can make a substantial difference? Are there barriers to those in poverty being able to utilize these advances? As global risks mount and geopolitics fragments, the worst off are left further behind.

Hartmut Neven: Founder and lead, Google Quantum AI Groundbreaker Topic: Quantum Leaps What do you think are the first few practically useful things we will see as a result of quantum computing? And when will we see them? We expect the first game-changing applications of quantum computing to be in chemistry, pharmacology and materials science. Quantum computers excel at simulating molecules and their interactions, and will provide computing power for problems that are even beyond supercomputers. Todays early quantum processors are already used for scientific discovery. As quantum computing systems are developed toward fully error-corrected quantum computers, which could take five-plus years to realize, they will be capable of running increasingly complex algorithms for breakthroughs in areas such as medical imaging, battery design or nuclear fusion.

Michael Oren: Former Israeli ambassador to the United States and author Groundbreaker Topic: The Future of the Middle East What do you believe Americas fundamental policies toward Iran should be? How should they shift? Since the advent of the Obama administration in 2009 -- with the exception of the first Trump administration -America has sought rapprochement with Iran. The policy was based on the belief that, if treated with respect and sufficiently incentivized, Iran would become a responsible regional power. The opposite happened. Iran expanded its regional influence, enhanced its support for terror and enabled the current Middle East war. The United States must recognize this reality and move from a policy of reconciliation with Iran to one of confrontation and deterrence. Full backing must be given to Americas allies in the region and a credible American military option returned to the table. Ai-jen Poo: President, the National Domestic Workers"}

Ai-jen Poo: President, the National Domestic Workers Alliance Groundbreaker Topic: Take Good Care What are the keys to unlocking affordable care while also providing living wages to caregivers? The key to unlocking affordable care and living wages for caregivers is to treat it like other essential infrastructure. Some of us need a bridge to get to work, others need care. The government should build care infrastructure by extending Medicare to cover home care, investing in Medicaid home and community based services, and tying funding to wage standards for care workers. As boomers age and we all live longer, the United States must catch up to our shared need for care. Rather than leaving individual families to shoulder the rising costs alone, it should be a shared, national priority.

Steve Rattner: Chairman and C.E.O., Willett Advisors Groundbreaker Topic: The Big Economic Policy Issues Facing the New Administration Whats your assessment of the health of the economy as we head into 2025? The state of the economy is a two-edged sword. On the one hand, unemployment is steady at a modest 4.1 percent. Growth remains brisk and steady. Inflation has subsided, almost to the Federal Reserves 2 percent target. Yet 75 percent of Americans rate the economy as fair or poor. What gives? Income inequality continues to rage and for the first time in memory, the American dream -- the notion that each generation will do better than the previous one -- is in jeopardy. Adjusted for inflation, just half of Americans born in 1980 earned more at age 30 than their parents did.

Is there a recent example you can share that surprised you? There is nothing like feeling a genuine warmth and welcome when you first enter a restaurant. For me, this is always the first step that makes the experience memorable. Of course, the quality of the food, the energy and d\u00e9cor is very important too. The other day I went to a new restaurant. They did not have my reservation in the books, though I did have one. A gentleman came over and introduced himself as the owner. He was incredibly warm and very personable and I felt welcomed. But I knew his demeanor was not just because of who I am as a chef; I could tell he would be like that for any guest.

Liev Schreiber: Co-founder, BlueCheck Ukraine, and actor Groundbreaker Topic: The People of Ukraine (Still) Need You What do you say to those who think Ukraine should just make a deal with Russia, give up some land and end the war? Completely separate of the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine is the geopolitical issue of democracy and the rising trend toward autocracy, dictatorships and authoritarianism generally. For me the war in Ukraine has always been a vivid reminder of just how precarious and vulnerable our own democracy is. Does anyone really believe that after acquiring Crimea, Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, Mykolaiv and Zaporizhzhia, Putin is actually going to stop? Is Ukraine enough? If Putin succeeds in Eastern Europe, what are the implications for Western Europe, Asia, Africa, and perhaps more importantly to us in the United States, what are the implications on our own democracy?

Rajiv Shah: President, the Rockefeller Foundation Groundbreaker Topic: Energy Transitions as the Common Denominator in Solving Global Crises How do energy transitions affect poverty? Research shows that 99 percent of people considered energy poor also experience at least one additional poverty indicator. Especially in the modern digital economy, electricity access determines a persons ability to get a job, start a business, or access education, health care and more. When we change energy, we change lives. We can also change the trajectory of climate change. Because the countries where energy access is lowest could produce as much as 75 percent of emissions by 2050, connecting people in those countries to clean energy is the only way to end poverty and end climate change.

Priscilla Sims Brown: President and C.E.O., Amalgamated Bank Groundbreaker Topic: Closing the Wealth Gap in our Financial Institutions What is Amalgamated Bank doing thats different to allow people access to credit that wasnt previously available to them? Small businesses are the backbone of the American economy and fostering entrepreneurship is key to wealth creation and reducing income inequality. While small businesses play a crucial role in local economies, access to capital remains a challenge, especially for minority-owned businesses (approximately 47 percent report unmet financing needs). Amalgamated Bank, founded in 1923 to make a positive impact through banking, believes a key component of bridging the financing gap is re-evaluating credit scoring. By including nontraditional data (rent and utility payments), business owners credit scores can benefit from the inclusion of additional key indicators of credit worthiness.

Why? Should anything be done to address this? Over history some big inventions -- like the farmers plow -- created a broad wealth. Others, like the cotton gin, created new wealth but concentrated it -- in that case, in the southern plantation. The benefits of technological growth depend on economic structure. A.I. could go either way. It could spread wealth by empowering startups, small and medium-sized businesses. But it might also reinforce extractive business models by marginalizing actual humans or by giving the tech platforms the power to extract from the rest of the economy. We should try for broader creation of wealth -- for reasons of political stability, if nothing else. Esther Manheimer: Mayor, Asheville, N.C.

Human beings have trouble thinking in exponentials. Think back to Covid, when we all had to do it. If you have one case of coronavirus and cases double every three days, then after 30 days, you have about 1,000 cases. That growth rate feels modest. It\u2019s manageable. But then you go 30 days longer, and you have a million. Then you wait another 30 days. Now you have a billion. That\u2019s the power of the exponential curve. Growth feels normal for a while. Then it gets out of control really, really quickly. What the A.I. developers say is that the power of A.I. systems is on this kind of curve, that it has been increasing exponentially, their capabilities, and that as long as we keep feeding in more data and more computing power, it will continue increasing exponentially.That is the scaling law hypothesis, and one of its"}

And then there\u2019s a spilling over of that process into the public sphere. And the spilling over looks very spiky. It looks like it\u2019s happening all of a sudden. It looks like it comes out of nowhere. And it\u2019s triggered by things hitting various critical points or just the public happened to be engaged at a certain time.

And it\u2019s triggered by things hitting various critical points or just the public happened to be engaged at a certain time. So I think the easiest way for me to describe this in terms of my own personal experience is \u2014 so I worked at OpenAI for five years, I was one of the first employees to join. And they built a model in 2018 called GPT-1, which used something like 100,000 times less computational power than the models we build today. I looked at that, and I and my colleagues were among the first to run what are called scaling laws, which is basically studying what happens as you vary the size of the model, its capacity to absorb information, and the amount of data that you feed into it. And we found these very smooth patterns. And we had this projection that, look, if you spend $100 million or $1 billion or $10 billion on these models, instead of the $10,000 we were spending then, projections that all of these wondrous things would happen, and we imagined that they would have enormous economic"}

Fast forward to about 2020. GPT-3 had just come out. It wasn\u2019t yet available as a chat bot. I led the development of that along with the team that eventually left to join Anthropic. And maybe for the whole period of 2021 and 2022, even though we continued to train models that were better and better, and OpenAI continued to train models, and Google continued to train models, there was surprisingly little public attention to the models. And I looked at that, and I said, well, these models are incredible. They\u2019re getting better and better. What\u2019s going on? Why isn\u2019t this happening? Could this be a case where I was right about the technology, but wrong about the economic impact, the practical value of the technology?

And then, all of a sudden, when ChatGPT came out, it was like all of that growth that you would expect, all of that excitement over three years, broke through and came rushing in. EZRA KLEIN: So I want to linger on this difference between the curve at which the technology is improving and the way it is being adopted by society. So when you think about these break points and you think into the future, what other break points do you see coming where A.I. bursts into social consciousness or used in a different way? DARIO AMODEI: Yeah, so I think I should say first that it\u2019s very hard to predict these. One thing I like to say is the underlying technology, because it\u2019s a smooth exponential, it\u2019s not perfectly predictable, but in some ways, it can be eerily preternaturally predictable, right? That\u2019s not true for these societal step functions at all. It\u2019s very hard to predict what will catch on. In some ways, it feels a little bit like which artist"}

In some ways, it feels a little bit like which artist or musician is going to catch on and get to the top of the charts. That said, a few possible ideas. I think one is related to something that you mentioned, which is interacting with the models in a more kind of naturalistic way. We\u2019ve actually already seen some of that with Claude 3, where people feel that some of the other models sound like a robot and that talking to Claude 3 is more natural. I think a thing related to this is, a lot of companies have been held back or tripped up by how their models handle controversial topics. And we were really able to, I think, do a better job than others of telling the model, don\u2019t shy away from discussing controversial topics. Don\u2019t assume that both sides necessarily have a valid point but don\u2019t express an opinion yourself. Don\u2019t express"}

As journalists, you encounter this all the time, right? How do I be objective, but not both sides on everything? So I think going further in that direction of models having personalities while still being objective, while still being useful and not falling into various ethical traps, that will be, I think, a significant unlock for adoption. The models taking actions in the world is going to be a big one. I know basically all the big companies that work on A.I. are working on that. Instead of just, I ask it a question and it answers, and then maybe I follow up and it answers again, can I talk to the model about, oh, I\u2019m going to go on this trip today, and the model says, oh, that\u2019s great.

And the model being able to do things end to end or going to websites or taking actions on your computer for you. I think all of that is coming in the next, I would say \u2014 I don\u2019t know \u2014 three to 18 months, with increasing levels of ability. I think that\u2019s going to change how people think about A.I., right, where so far, it\u2019s been this very passive \u2014 it\u2019s like, I go to the Oracle.

And I think it might be a good way to look at some of the specific technological and cultural challenges. And so, let me offer two versions of it. People who are following the A.I. news might have heard about Devin, which is not in release yet, but is an A.I. that at least purports to be able to complete the kinds of tasks, linked tasks, that a junior software engineer might complete, right? Instead of asking to do a bit of code for you, you say, listen, I want a website. It\u2019s going to have to do these things, work in these ways.

And maybe Devin, if it works the way people are saying it works, can actually hold that set of thoughts, complete a number of different tasks, and come back to you with a result. I\u2019m also interested in the version of this that you might have in the real world. The example I always use in my head is, when can I tell an A.I., my son is turning five. He loves dragons. We live in Brooklyn. Give me some options for planning his birthday party. And then, when I choose between them, can you just do it all for me? Order the cake, reserve the room, send out the invitations, whatever it might be. Those are two different situations because one of them is in code, and one of them is making decisions in the real world, interacting with real people, knowing if what it is finding on the websites is actually any good.

What is between here and there? When I say that in plain language to you, what technological challenges or advances do you hear need to happen to get there? DARIO AMODEI: The short answer is not all that much. A story I have from when we were developing models back in 2022 \u2014 and this is before we\u2019d hooked up the models to anything \u2014 is, you could have a conversation with these purely textual models where you could say, hey, I want to reserve dinner at restaurant X in San Francisco, and the model would say, OK, here\u2019s the website of restaurant X. And it would actually give you a correct website or would tell you to go to Open Table or something. And of course, it can\u2019t actually go to the website. The power plug isn\u2019t actually plugged in, right? The brain of the robot is not actually attached to its arms and legs. But it gave you this sense that the brain, all it needed to do was learn exactly how to use the arms and legs,"}

The brain of the robot is not actually attached to its arms and legs. But it gave you this sense that the brain, all it needed to do was learn exactly how to use the arms and legs, right? It already had a picture of the world and where it would walk and what it would do. And so, it felt like there was this very thin barrier between the passive models we had and actually acting in the world. In terms of what we need to make it work, one thing is, literally, we just need a little bit more scale. And I think the reason we\u2019re going to need more scale is \u2014 to do one of those things you described, to do all the things a junior software engineer does, they involve chains of long actions, right? I have to write this line of code. I have to run this test. I have to write a new test. I have to check how it looks in the app after I interpret it or compile it. And these things can easily"}

And same with planning the birthday party for your son, right? And if the accuracy of any given step is not very high, is not like 99.9 percent, as you compose these steps, the probability of making a mistake becomes itself very high. So the industry is going to get a new generation of models every probably four to eight months. And so, my guess \u2014 I\u2019m not sure \u2014 is that to really get these things working well, we need maybe one to four more generations. So that ends up translating to 3 to 24 months or something like that. I think second is just, there is some algorithmic work that is going to need to be done on how to have the models interact with the world in this way.

I think the basic techniques we have, a method called reinforcement learning and variations of it, probably is up to the task, but figuring out exactly how to use it to get the results we want will probably take some time. And then third, I think \u2014 and this gets to something that Anthropic really specializes in \u2014 is safety and controllability. And I think that\u2019s going to be a big issue for these models acting in the world, right? Let\u2019s say this model is writing code for me, and it introduces a serious security bug in the code, or it\u2019s taking actions on the computer for me and modifying the state of my computer in ways that are too complicated for me to even understand. And for planning the birthday party, right, the level of trust you would need to take an A.I. agent and say, I\u2019m OK with you calling up anyone, saying anything to them that\u2019s in any private"}

And so, we\u2019re going to need to figure out what is safe and controllable. The more open ended the thing is, the more powerful it is, but also, the more dangerous it is and the harder it is to control. So I think those questions, although they sound lofty and abstract, are going to turn into practical product questions that we and other companies are going to be trying to address. EZRA KLEIN: When you say we\u2019re just going to need more scale, you mean more compute and more training data, and I guess, possibly more money to simply make the models smarter and more capable? DARIO AMODEI: Yes, we\u2019re going to have to make bigger models that use more compute per iteration. We\u2019re going to"}

DARIO AMODEI: Yes, we\u2019re going to have to make bigger models that use more compute per iteration. We\u2019re going to have to run them for longer by feeding more data into them. And that number of chips times the amount of time that we run things on chips is essentially dollar value because these chips are \u2014 you rent them by the hour. That\u2019s the most common model for it. And so, today\u2019s models cost of order $100 million to train, plus or minus factor two or three. The models that are in training now and that will come out at various times later this year or early next year are closer in cost to $1 billion. So that\u2019s already happening. And then I think in 2025 and 2026, we\u2019ll get more towards $5 or $10 billion.

You can have some kind of partnership of various kinds with a large company. Or governments would be the other source. I think one way that it\u2019s not correct is, we\u2019re always going to have a thriving ecosystem of experimentation on small models. For example, the open source community working to make models that are as small and as efficient as possible that are optimized for a particular use case. And also downstream usage of the models.

The two movements are generally hostile to each other, but they are in a strange agreement on the matter of human culture. In an effort to assimilate seemingly inexplicable human achievements into the evolutionary framework of natural selection acting on blind variation, the evolutionary theorist (and popularizer of the gene-centered theory) Richard Dawkins developed the concept of memes \u2014self-replicating units of cultural meaning \u2014 and suggested that the mind plays passive host to memes in the same way the body does genes.

On the matter of human psychology, the neo-Darwinist subdiscipline of cognitive science tells us that our brains are algorithms for the processing of information. Through brute trial and error, we have learned which algorithmic outputs will produce material rewards. Subjective, qualitative experience, which inevitably retains a hint of the spiritual, has been removed from the picture, as has the idea that individual humans might be capable of acting in ways not determined by millenniums of genetic history.

This spirit is exemplified by the dread over artificial intelligence. We have credulously swallowed an idea of culture as an empty power game and ourselves as walking algorithms \u2014 an idea that runs contrary to our deepest experiences.

Socrates claimed throughout his life to be visited by a spirit \u2014 \u201cdaimonion\u201din Greek, \u201cgenius\u201din Latin. The spirit did not grant him any substantive knowledge; it only guided his actions, particularly warning him against certain behavior. His career as a public gadfly began when an oracle praised him for knowing more than any other citizen of Athens. Believing himself to know nothing, he started wandering the city, asking prominent Athenians some basic questions: What is truth? What is knowledge? What is justice? From their answers, he concluded that he was ahead of the pack only because he recognized his own ignorance.

In the Christian era, the person touched by genius gave way to the mystic-saint who had achieved ecstatic moments of unity with God. While a small number of people dedicated their lives to mystical practice, an immediate encounter with the divine was recognized as a possibility for any person at any time. Reality had deep truths that could not be arrived at by way of the intellect, and these truths could make themselves manifest in surprising ways. With the rise of the Enlightenment, tutelary spirits and divine visitations went out of favor, but secular culture could not quite do away with the allure of genius. People now spoke of certain human beings as being geniuses, not as having geniuses, but the term still indicated something other than simple intelligence. The German philosopher Immanuel Kant claimed all truly great art \u2014 the kind that could transform us rather than simply entertain us \u2014 was the product of genius.

Even in an era of extraordinary technological breakthroughs, genius was most likely to be identified with artists and poets, in part because there was still a belief that art could deliver profound human truths unavailable to us through other means. For the Romantics, one good indicator of genius was a marked lack of aptitude for mathematics, which they considered simply a technical skill grounded in following rules. Something of this old thrust still applied to our elevation of the 20th century\u2019s great scientific geniuses. Figures like Einstein, G\u00f6del, von Neumann and Oppenheimer were thought to possess intuitive powers that seemed only tangentially related to their quantitative abilities.

In fact, it\u2019s as old as the concept of genius itself. While Socrates inspired a nearly religious devotion in his followers, many Athenians found him frankly ridiculous. Still others found him dangerous, and this faction managed to sentence him to death, a verdict he accepted with equanimity.

Even Kant noted the perpetual challenge of distinguishing the genius from the charlatan: \u201cNonsense, too, can be original,\u201d he acknowledged. What seems to have changed more recently is not our understanding of the risk of the pseudo-genius but our suspicion of the very possibility of genius of the genuine sort, and this has everything to do with the larger cultural developments of the past 50 years.

Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk have all been awarded the status at one time or another. In the process we have rendered the term useless. When the clearest sign of genius is a net worth in 10 figures, we have come a long way from the ascetic outsider who suffers for the truth. Under such conditions, it\u2019s hardly surprising that the term is treated as a cynical bit of marketing we\u2019d be better off without.

Luckily, we have little reason to think that a computer program is capable of such a thing. On the other hand, we have ample reason to think that human beings are. Believing again in genius means believing in the possibility that something truly new might come along to change things for the better.

An Army veteran, Mr. Rendon explored training programs he could fund using his military benefits. He landed on a coding boot camp. At first, the intensive courses seemed intimidating.

A.I. is one of those subjects that seem to appear out of nowhere, blotting out everything else -- like the sun rising over the desert -- and a mixture of ludicrous hype and vacuous panic has rushed in to shade the blinding dazzle. A.I. is going to transform every industry, or its going to end the world, or both, and you need to know which now. Meanwhile, accurate answers to basic questions -- What even is it? How does it work? Where did it come from? Where is it going? -- tend to be tucked away in dry technical language that borders on the incomprehensible. Before the launch of ChatGPT, a little more than a year ago, it was difficult to get readers to care about A.I. Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI, would tell anybody who would listen that A.I. needed regulation, but few in power were listening. Editors sniffed. Readers yawned.

And, after a decade during which Silicon Valley has demonstrated that it lacks any sense of social responsibility, it has become impossible to trust the creators of A.I. Then there is the confounding nature of the technology itself, which often eludes the understanding even of the people who invented it. Its amazing that anything good about A.I. ever gets written.

The Alignment Problem, by Brian Christian (2020) If youre going to read one book on artificial intelligence, this is the one. Though it was published in 2020, which in terms of A.I. is practically prehistory, I still think its fairer and more illuminating than almost anything published since. Its chief value is its close examination of the computer scientists, cognitive psychologists and philosophers who were present at its birth. You just cant beat dense reporting. The problem with A.I. isnt that its going to end the world, Christian says. The problem is determining how to align machine behavior with human values, a conundrum we have been trying and mostly failing to solve since the invention of the cotton gin.

Christian, the author of two previous books about the intersection of humans and computers, is admirably clear: The trouble isnt only the machines; its the people. To align machines with human values, we have to know what human values are, and that knowledge is hazy at best. We cling to theories of fairness and transparency, which grow vaguer and vaguer when we try to put them into practice.

Chief Justice Roberts has long been interested in the intersection of law and technology. He wrote the majority opinions in decisions generally requiring the government to obtain warrants to search digital information on cellphones seized from people who have been arrested and to collect troves of location data about the customers of cellphone companies. In his 2017 visit to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, the chief justice was asked whether he could foresee a day when smart machines, driven with artificial intelligences, will assist with courtroom fact-finding or, more controversially even, judicial decision-making? The chief justice said yes. Its a day thats here, he said, and its putting a significant strain on how the judiciary goes about doing things. He appeared to be referring to software used in sentencing decisions. That strain has only increased, the chief justice wrote on Sunday. In criminal cases, the use of A.I. in assessing flight risk, recidivism and other largely discretionary decisions that involve predictions has generated concerns about due process, reliability and potential bias, he wrote.

At least at present, studies show a persistent public perception of a human-A.I. fairness gap, reflecting the view that human adjudications, for all of their flaws, are fairer than whatever the machine spits out. Chief Justice Roberts concluded that legal determinations often involve gray areas that still require application of human judgment. Judges, for example, measure the sincerity of a defendants allocution at sentencing, he wrote. Nuance matters: Much can turn on a shaking hand, a quivering voice, a change of inflection, a bead of sweat, a moments hesitation, a fleeting break in eye contact. And most people still trust humans more than machines to perceive and draw the right inferences from these clues. Appellate judges will not soon be supplanted, either, he wrote. Many appellate decisions turn on whether a lower court has abused its discretion, a standard that by its nature involves fact-specific gray areas, the chief justice wrote.

Google said on Friday what it thought should change to address a ruling that it had illegally maintained a monopoly over online search: not much. Googles proposal followed the landmark ruling in August by Judge Amit P. Mehta of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, who said Google had illegally maintained a monopoly in online search by paying companies like Apple and Samsung to be the search engine that automatically appears when users open a web browser or a smartphone. In response, the government last month asked the judge to force Google to sell Chrome, the worlds most popular browser, among other remedies. In Googles own proposal to fix the search monopoly, it asked Judge Mehta to allow it to continue to pay other companies for its search engine to get prime placement. But it said those agreements should be less restrictive than in the past.

Next year, the Federal Trade Commission is expected to go to trial against Meta, over claims that it snuffed out competition when it bought Instagram and WhatsApp. The agency has also filed a lawsuit against Amazon, accusing it of illegally protecting a monopoly in online retail, and is investigating Microsofts power in cloud computing and artificial intelligence.

A second Justice Department case against Google, alleging that it has a monopoly in advertising technology, is awaiting a decision by a federal judge in the coming weeks. In the search case, which was filed in 2020 under the first administration of President-elect Donald J. Trump, Judge Mehta agreed with the government that Google had benefited from a cycle of dominance. In a 10-week trial last year, Justice Department lawyers said Google had locked out rivals by signing deals with Apple, Mozilla, Samsung and others to automatically appear as the search engine when users open a smartphone or a new tab in a web browser. In total, Google paid $26.3 billion as part of those deals in 2021, according to evidence presented at the trial. Google argued that its deals had not broken the law and that users chose Google because it was better at finding information than search engines like Microsofts Bing or DuckDuckGo, a product that promises more privacy for its users.

It also asked the court to stop the company from entering into paid agreements with Apple and others to be the search engine that is automatically selected on smartphones and in browsers. Google should also allow rival search engines to display the companys results and have access to its data for a decade, the government proposed. The government also said Google, whose parent company is Alphabet, should be forced to divest its stake in any artificial intelligence products that could compete with search, a bid to stop the company from dominating the nascent technology.

Last fall, France successfully lobbied in Brussels to limit regulation of open-source A.I. systems in the European Unions new Artificial Intelligence Act, a victory that helps Mistral maintain a rapid development pace. If Mistral becomes a big technical power, said Mr. O, the former digital minister who led the lobbying effort, its going to be beneficial for all of Europe.

Mr. Biden articulated some of the principles behind these commitments: First, the companies have an obligation to make sure their technology is safe before releasing it to the public. That means testing the capabilities of their systems, assessing their potential risk and making the results of these assessments public. Second, companies must prioritize the security of their systems by safeguarding their models against cyberthreats and managing the risks to our national security, and sharing the best practices and industry standards that are necessary.

There were plenty of people in the room who had publicly disavowed former President Donald Trump after the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol -- Peltz among them -- but it was pretty clear now that he was going to be the candidate, and it was time to get onboard and figure out how to help him win. There were a lot of problems. An especially uncomfortable one was that a lot of donor money was going to paying Trumps mounting legal bills rather than building a serious political campaign. Peltz, who was 81 at the time and made his fortune via junk bonds and leveraged buyouts, had gathered some traditional high rollers, including the hedge-fund manager John Paulson and the Las Vegas casino tycoon Steve Wynn, as well as Ronna McDaniel, then the chair of the Republican National Committee.

It was business as usual, until some approached a line that was almost empty. One by one, they walked to a kiosk with an iPad affixed to it and had their photos taken, as a security officer stood by. Within seconds, each passengers image was matched to a photo from a government database, and the traveler was ushered past security into the deeper maze of the airport.

The T.S.A. has experimented with facial recognition technology since 2019. Screening verification currently offered at Denver and Los Angeles International Airports and some 30 other airports starts when a photo is taken of the traveler. Then facial recognition software is used to match the image to a physical scan of a license or passport. The photo is deleted shortly afterward, according to the agency.

At the borders The fastest growing use of facial recognition software at U.S. airports so far has been in security measures for entering and exiting the United States. The growth stems from a 2001 congressional mandate, in the wake of 9/11, requiring the implementation of a system that would allow all travelers arriving and departing the United States to be identified using biometric technology. Overseen by the Customs and Border Protection agency, the biometric system for those entering the United States is in place, and scanned 113 million entries at airports last year.

And so while we may not trust each other, will we trust the technology instead? A different kind of trust issue arose at one of the four DealBook task forces, one titled Women, Power and Money and moderated by a New York Times reporter, Jodi Kantor.

Perhaps nowhere is trust -- or the lack of it -- going to be more consequential than in the economic fate of the world. The Federal Reserve is one of most powerful and independent institutions in Washington that has uniquely relied on being trusted for its entire existence. Its independence has been a cornerstone of that trust, but one that increasingly may have to be earned given the skepticism that has bubbled up in this moment of distrust. Were not in the Constitution, Jerome H. Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said at the DealBook Summit. Were a creature of statute. So thats what independent means. And that gives us the ability to make these decisions for the benefit of all Americans at all times, not for any particular political party or political outcome."}

But the industry pulled back from hiring at the same time that new A.I. coding tools were starting to become mainstream. In 2022, Google\u2019s A.I. team, DeepMind, reported that it had tested its A.I. model AlphaCode in coding competitions, and that it was as good as \u201ca novice programmer with a few months to a year of training.\u201d It took a few more years, but the tools available to a typical programmer have since improved markedly.

The real proof is among developers: About 60 percent of 65,000 developers surveyed in May by StackOverflow, a software developer community, said they had used A.I. coding tools this year. Not everyone sees these developments as a death knell for coding jobs.

And it mandated a kill switch to turn off A.I. systems in case of potential biowarfare, mass casualties or property damage.

The California governor said that the bill was well-intentioned but left out key ways of measuring risk and other consumer harms. He said that the bill does not take into account whether an A.I. system is deployed in high-risk environments, involves critical decision making or the use of sensitive data. Mr. Newsom said he had asked several technology and legal scholars to help come up with regulatory guardrails for generative A.I., including Fei-Fei Li, a professor of computer science at Stanford; Mariano-Florentino Cu\u00c3\u00a9llar, a member of the National Academy of Sciences Committee on Social and Ethical Implications of Computing Research; and Jennifer Tour Chayes, dean of the College of Computing, Data Science, and Society at University of California, Berkeley.

Ms. Li of Stanford, whom Mr. Newsom referred to as the godmother of A.I., wrote in an opinion piece last month that the bill would harm our budding AI ecosystem, and give the biggest A.I. companies an advantage by penalizing smaller developers and academic researchers who would have to meet testing standards. OpenAI, Google, Meta and Microsoft opposed the legislation, saying it could stifle innovation and set back the United States in the global race to dominate A.I. Venture capital investors, including Andreessen Horowitz, said the measure would hurt A.I. start-ups that didnt have the resources required to test their systems. Several California representatives in Congress wrote Mr. Newsom with warnings that the bill was too hypothetical and unnecessarily put safety standards on a nascent technology. Representative Nancy Pelosi, the former House speaker, also asked her fellow Democrat to veto the bill.

Other technologists and some business leaders, including Elon Musk, took the opposite position, saying the potential harms of A.I. are too great to postpone regulations. They warned that A.I. could be used to disrupt elections with widespread disinformation, facilitate biowarfare and create other catastrophic situations. Mr. Musk posted last month on X, his social media site, that it was a tough call but that all things considered, he supported the bill because of the technologys potential risks to the public.

This month, 50 academics sent a letter to Mr. Newsom describing the bill as reasonable and an important deterrent for the fast deployment of unsafe models. Decisions about whether to release future powerful A.I. models should not be taken lightly, and they should not be made purely by companies that dont face any accountability for their actions, wrote the academics, including Geoffrey Hinton, a University of Toronto professor known as the godfather of A.I. Amba Kak, president of the AI Now think tank and a former adviser on A.I. to the Federal Trade Commission, said, When debates about regulating A.I. get reduced to Silicon Valley infighting, we lose sight of the broader stakes for the public."}

There is rising and perhaps unexpected alignment between Americans of different walks of life, from left to right. Granted, this alignment may at first glance seem like a problem, for what unites us, increasingly, is what we distrust. But consider this: We have thought of ourselves as so divided for so long, might there be some upside to starting the new year knowing we aren\u2019t quite as polarized as we thought and that people with whom we assumed we had nothing in common also believe our institutions must do better? Since the early 1990s, majorities of Americans have said that our nation is \u201cgreatly divided when it comes to our most important values,\u201d except for the year after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. In the weeks before the 2024 elections, Americans reported a record-high level of division.

But as a pollster, I was intrigued to see that the November elections pumped the brakes a bit on our previously widening political divisions. We didn\u2019t move further apart; if anything, these elections produced a slight depolarization of our country along a number of fault lines, as 89 percent of counties in America shifted rightward. The gap between how men and women voted shrank by three percentage points, a notable result in a campaign where some political experts expected a record gender gap. Voters under 30 years old and voters over 65 \u2014 two groups that were worlds apart in the 2020 presidential election, voting nearly 30 points in opposite directions \u2014 came closer together in 2024, around a dozen points apart in their preference for president.

What we are experiencing in our society is a reorientation of many of our existing political divides. Organizations, professions and institutions that were recently trusted by at least one side of the political aisle have come in for greater scrutiny, with new bipartisan alignment on skepticism. Take business. Not long ago, many Republican Party leaders and plenty of G.O.P. voters believed in the value of business, the need to protect business from government interference and the virtues of job creators. In 2012, for instance, only 23 percent of Republicans said they had \u201cvery little\u201d or no trust in \u201cbig business,\u201d while 38 percent had \u201cquite a lot\u201d or \u201ca great deal\u201d of trust.

And in November\u2019s election, Mr. Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, ran on a populist message that included skepticism of big business and the financial and hiring practices of many companies, including their use of immigrants in the labor force. Another major institution that was more trusted in the 2000s and 2010s is the military. Post-9/11, Republicans reported sky-high confidence in the military, even as Democratic confidence hovered 20 to 30 points lower. But in a very short period, starting in 2020, Republican confidence in the military dropped a whopping 23 points. Today, Republicans and Democrats have nearly the same level of trust in the armed forces.

This is not a phenomenon that affects only conservative-coded institutions. The news media finds itself increasingly fragmented, experiencing convulsions driven in part by social media, cord cutting and generative artificial intelligence. As traditional media sources compete with new and emerging creators, they also face declining trust from the American people. Republicans have long harbored significant skepticism of mass media, which Gallup defines as \u201cnewspapers, TV and radio,\u201d when it comes to fairly reporting on the news.

Other once-admired institutions are finding themselves in similar situations. Take higher education. Less than a decade ago, colleges and universities were trusted by 57 percent of Americans and in fairly bipartisan fashion. Today, Republican trust in higher education has cratered to only 20 percent, and Democrats\u2019 has also trended downward, though at a slower pace. This cross-partisan rise in distrust has caught countless leaders and executives off guard.

Part of what\u2019s driving this are the ways in which the faults of our institutions are laid bare and amplified, at times unfairly, in our current information ecosystem. While the average American has greater visibility than ever into many of our key institutions\u2019 actions, that transparency has not led to more trust.

Only 17 percent of Republicans and 38 percent of Democrats said they felt \u201csatisfied\u201d with the way democracy was working in our country over the past year, figures that are miles from the generally satisfied view of Americans as recently as the late 1990s.

As one of the respondents in a recent Times focus group of Trump voters put it, \u201cSomeone just mentioned that we were divided, but I feel like this last election showed that we\u2019re a little more unified than we thought we were, than maybe mainstream media thought we were.\u201d Speaking to that distrust \u2014 acknowledging Americans\u2019 well-founded frustration with the status quo and doing so in a way that isunifying\u2014 is what I believe Americans are looking for, at least as a first step.

Voters are looking for things to be fixed, not obliterated. If Mr. Trump wishes to retain the support he cultivated in the election, he cannot just smash the old things or resort to demagoguery and blaming institutions; he must build things that are in touch and responsive to the entire country he will again lead. Crucially, to keep his coalition together, the institutions he leads must deliver on their promise of prosperity and peace rather than simply be demolished and cast aside. There is an opportunity here: The bipartisan anger is real and could be harnessed for bold action to address problems that have left people frustrated and skeptical. The next and much harder step for our nation\u2019s leaders will be making institutions worthy of our trust again."}

In the late 1780s, shortly after the Industrial Revolution had begun, Alexander Hamilton, James Madison and John Jay wrote a series of 85 spirited essays, collectively known as the Federalist Papers. They argued for ratification of the Constitution and an American system of checks and balances to keep power-hungry \u201cfactions\u201d in check. A new project, orchestrated by Stanford University and published on Tuesday, is inspired by the Federalist Papers and contends that today is a broadly similar historical moment of economic and political upheaval that calls for a rethinking of society\u2019s institutional arrangements. In an introduction to its collection of 12 essays, called the Digitalist Papers, the editors overseeing the project, including Erik Brynjolfsson, director of the Stanford Digital Economy Lab, and Condoleezza Rice, secretary of state in the George W.

Replacing defunct or outdated laptops costs money. When it comes to I.T., many schools are understaffed. More of the money being spent on tech and the maintenance and training around the use of that tech could be spent on other things, like actual books.

The results of that internal debate also underscore the constraints and challenges the government faces in issuing rules that keep pace with rapid advances in technology, particularly in electronic surveillance and related areas of computer-assisted intelligence gathering and analysis. The administration had to navigate two competing goals, according to a senior administration official, Joshua Geltzer, the top legal adviser to the National Security Council: \u201charnessing emerging technology to protect Americans, and establishing guardrails for safeguarding Americans\u2019 privacy and other considerations.\u201d The White House last month held back the four-page, unclassified directive when President Biden signed a major national security memo that pushes military and intelligence agencies to make greater use of A.I. within certain guardrails.

The answers they reached, the document shows, are preliminary. Because the technology is evolving quickly, national security lawyers for Mr. Biden decided the government must revisit the guidance in six months \u2014 a task that will now fall to the Trump administration. The A.I. systems that private sector companies are developing, like OpenAI\u2019s large language model, Chat GPT, apparently far surpass anything the government can do.

Training A.I. systems requires feeding them large amounts of data, raising a critical question for intelligence agencies that could influence both Americans\u2019 privacy interests and the ability of national security agencies to experiment with the technology. When an agency acquires an A.I. system trained by a private sector firm using information about Americans, is that considered \u201ccollecting\u201d the data of those Americans? The answer determines whether or when long-existing limits for what a national-security agency can do with personal data about Americans, developed for surveillance programs, kick in. Rules for what an agency employees can do with domestic information it has collected include limiting when they may retain such data, how they must store it, the date by when they must delete it, under what circumstances their analysts may query it, and when and how the agencies may disseminate it to other parts of the government.

The Biden legal team, Mr. Geltzer said, worried that applying those privacy rules at the point when A.I. systems are acquired would severely inhibit agencies\u2019 ability to experiment with the new technology. As a result, the guidance says that when an intelligence agency acquires an artificial intelligence system that was trained using Americans\u2019 data, that does not generally count as collecting the training data \u2014 so those existing privacy-protecting rules, along with a 2021 directive about collecting commercially available databases, are not yet triggered. Still, the Biden team was not absolute on that question.

The Times and several other news organizations are suing OpenAI and Microsoft over their use of copyrighted news articles to train chatbots. The Biden team also addressed what it would mean if an agency uses data about Americans already in its possession to modify or augment an A.I. system. That could be fine-tuning the system\u2019s training to change how it weighs certain factors, or connecting it to additional data and tools without altering its underlying processes. In that case, the document says, longstanding attorney general guidelines about spy agencies\u2019 using, querying, retaining and disseminating Americans\u2019 information kick in \u2014 as do laws that can further limit what the government may do with domestic information, like the Privacy Act."}

And it raises particular caution about feeding an A.I. system with information gathered by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act: Officials are required to consult the Justice Department and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence first. In the world of national security surveillance, there are rules limiting when an analyst may query a database of raw intercepts in search of information about Americans. The guidance examined a similar issue: when an intelligence official may prompt an A.I. system by asking it a question about an American.

Now, in an effort to better predict what storms are coming and how to transition out of a fossil-dependent grid, utilities are looking to a new generation of technologies driven by artificial intelligence.

Utilities need to spend a lot of money to update their power systems to deal with storms both present and future. Were still thinking of the grid as we have for the past 100 years, and its increasingly obvious that needs to change, said Mark Dyson, managing director of the carbon-free electricity program at the global research firm Rocky Mountain Institute.

I suspect that the amount of energy we would spend more than pays for itself in terms of maintaining an affordable and reliable grid, Mr. Dyson said. But the data to support that suspicion doesnt exist yet. The industry is so immature we dont have an outlook yet for the types of sectors that would be most advantaged from A.I.

Whereas A.I. startups rely on tech giants for processing power, Google uses its own. The company\u2019s products, like YouTube and Gmail, give it access to mountains of data, and its A.I. researchers have made huge breakthroughs, with two of them winning a Nobel Prize this year.

On A.I. safety and regulation Geoffrey Hinton, a former Google engineer who won a Nobel Prize this year for his work in artificial intelligence, left the company last year and warned of the technology\u2019s dangers. Regulators around the world have taken vastly different approaches to regulating the technology, and the U.S. federal government has been slow to put any guardrails around A.I., even as executives like Altman have suggested that such is necessary. Pichai said he was \u201cdefinitely on the optimistic side\u201d about the potential impact of A.I. and argued that existing regulation already covered a lot of the uses for artificial intelligence. For example, he said: It\u2019s not like you can bring a treatment in without going through all the regulatory approvals.

The business model around the enormous amounts of data used to create A.I. models is in flux.

This is the tragicomic scene summoned in cardboard and packing tape by Thomas Hirschhorn, 66, a Swiss artist known since the 90s for wrestling humble materials into cacophonous installations: rows of PCs and desks, a ceiling festooned with smiley-face and purple devil emojis dangling from ropes of tape, and life-size cutouts of geared-up video game soldiers.

It is an end-of-year State Capitol tradition, a lawmaker\u2019s parallel to the tree lighting at Rockefeller Center: a holiday checklist of scores of bills that await Gov. Kathy Hochul\u2019s signature or veto before the new year. The bills, as they typically do, vary in consequence and scope. Ms. Hochul, for example, signed a bill last week requiring health insurers to cover the costs of EpiPens for people with allergies. She vetoed a bill prohibiting the removal of horseshoe crabs from their natural habitats. And she left hanging a bill that would push state economic development officials to promote the game of stickball. The stickball bill is among roughly 105 pieces of legislation awaiting her consideration. In most cases, any bill she does not act on before Jan. 1 will be effectively vetoed.

Apple, which by then had $155 billion in cash, spent lavishly to hire hundreds of people with experience in machine learning, a type of A.I. technology, and other capabilities crucial to making a self-driving car. The influx of people made the project among the first that Apple had developed with so many outsiders new to the company\u2019s culture.

The agency recently sent a long and detailed formal request for information to the company asking about its cloud computing, artificial intelligence and cybersecurity products, the people said. Of particular interest to the F.T.C. is the way that Microsoft bundles its cloud computing offerings with office and security products, they added, alongside the companys growing power in the artificial intelligence space.

(The New York Times has sued OpenAI and Microsoft, claiming copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems. The two companies have denied the suits claims.) Microsoft has come under recent scrutiny for high-profile system failures that have underscored the central role it plays in the infrastructure of the internet.

If the customers wanted to use another cloud provider instead of Microsoft, they had to buy additional software licenses and effectively pay a penalty, the group said. Microsoft has long faced criticism from competitors that it bundles its products in a way that makes it hard for rivals to compete.

Roughly the size of a pickup truck, Maximo has a large extendable arm that uses suction cups to pick up solar panels one by one and lay them neatly into rows, using artificial intelligence and computer vision to position them properly. After months of testing, AES will put Maximo to work in the California desert later this year to help install panels at the largest solar-plus-battery project under construction, meant to help power Amazon data centers.

If all goes well, the company aims to build hundreds of similar A.I.-powered robots. Its part of a growing trend: Energy companies want to use automation to overcome worker shortages, cut costs and speed up the construction of large solar farms, which has traditionally been very labor-intensive. Without drastic changes, these companies say, it will be impossible to deploy solar power fast enough to tackle global warming and meet the countrys rapidly growing need for electricity. Were seeing labor shortages on construction projects in the United States, and its a bottleneck to the build-out of solar farms, said Andr\u00e9s Gluski, chief executive of AES, in an interview. So how do you get around it? Well, robots can work 24 hours, right? Robots can pick up 80-pound solar panels, not a problem.

Whenever automation comes up, theres always this push and pull, said Katie Harris, vice president of federal affairs at the BlueGreen Alliance, a partnership of labor unions and environmental groups. It can help folks be more productive, but we also want to create good-paying union jobs, and automation isnt always a friend there. Demand for solar power is expected to grow astronomically over the next decade thanks to the plummeting costs of panels, hundreds of billions of dollars in federal subsidies and growing interest from tech companies in securing carbon-free electricity for their data centers. By some estimates, the country will need 475,000 solar workers by 2033, nearly double todays number. Yet 44 percent of solar companies already say it is very difficult to find qualified workers, according to one recent survey.

It can be especially hard to recruit construction workers for large solar arrays, which are often located in remote desert areas. The job involves lifting and installing hundreds of panels per day, each one weighing 60 pounds or more, in places where temperatures can reach in excess of 110 degrees Fahrenheit, or about 43 Celsius. Getting machines to do the job isnt easy, however. Unlike the robots that work on assembly lines inside factories, robots that operate outdoors have to withstand rain, dirt and mud while dealing with uneven terrain and other surprises. To overcome those hurdles, AES is counting on advances in artificial intelligence that allow its robots to recognize and adjust to different types of solar modules and difficult outdoor conditions. One of the biggest issues we had to deal with was glare, said Deise Yumi Asami, who founded the companys Maximo project. When the robot moved from New York to Ohio for testing, it suddenly faced different angles of sunlight reflecting off modules and the companys engineers had to train the robot to adapt."}

When the robot moved from New York to Ohio for testing, it suddenly faced different angles of sunlight reflecting off modules and the companys engineers had to train the robot to adapt. To date, AES has installed 10 megawatts of solar panels with its robots, about enough to power 2,000 homes. The company plans to use Maximo to install 100 megawatts by 2025, though that is still a fraction of the 5,000 megawatts of solar the company expects to build in the next three years. AES hopes to eventually deploy hundreds of robots. Mr. Gluski, the chief executive, pointed out that AES was one of the first companies to feed power from lithium-ion batteries to the electric grid, a practice that started slowly but has since become widespread. Theres a learning curve, like with all new technologies, he said. Currently, it takes 12 to 18 months to build a large solar farm.

But with the United States experiencing a frenzy of data center construction and many businesses looking to quickly secure energy supplies, AES wants to cut construction times significantly. Other solar companies are also exploring automation. Built Robotics, a San Francisco-based start-up, is using pile-driving robots to build the foundations for solar farms. By automating some processes, a task that typically takes 6 to 7 workers can be done with two workers up to three times as fast, the company said. Terabase Energy, a start-up based in Berkeley, Calif., has developed a small mobile factory that uses robots to assemble solar modules on-site and install them on racks. The technology has already been used to install 17 megawatts of panels at a solar farm in Arizona and the company says it has made construction 25 percent faster. Matt Campbell, the chief executive of Terabase, wants to slash the cost of solar power in half. Solar power is already one of the cheapest ways to generate electricity.

But if the world wants to use energy from the sun to replace natural gas for making fertilizer or hydrogen fuels, then solar power needs to get even cheaper, he said. The costs of the panels themselves dont have room to fall too much further. The only way you can get there is to make the construction a lot less expensive, Mr. Campbell said. Many fossil-fuel companies in the United States have already used automation to cut costs: Over the past decade, the number of workers in oil and gas drilling has fallen by 40 percent even as production has reached record highs. Mr. Gluski said he doesnt expect robots to completely replace workers. My idea is not to hire less people, but to do twice as much with the same number of people, he said, adding that robots could make the work safer for humans by taking on the taxing work of lifting heavy solar panels in the heat."}

The Laborers International Union of North America, one of the countrys largest construction unions, did not respond to a request for comment. Ms. Harris, of the BlueGreen Alliance, said she was skeptical that even rapid automation would fully fix the looming shortage of clean-energy workers and that policymakers would still need to invest in training and apprenticeship programs. When it comes to the future, Mr. Gluski said he didnt think robots would be building wind farms anytime soon, since those tend to be gigantic. But, he added, AES was increasingly interested in using artificial intelligence to do tasks such as identifying potential wind and solar sites that could be developed the fastest or better predicting when wind turbines need maintenance. All of that would make renewable energy cheaper and faster to deploy,"}

The top-performing models used even more data than Dr. Kaplan had predicted in his paper. One model, Chinchilla, was trained on 1.4 trillion tokens. It was soon overtaken.

Rich, whose 10th collection of short stories, Glory Days, was released this week, said his dark view of the future was informed by a longtime friendship with an A.I. scientist, who recently showed him a chatbot the public hasnt seen. Its more raw, unpredictable, creative. Even though I dont know anything about A.I. really, Ive been processing it emotionally for several years longer than everyone, he told me in his Los Angeles home office one afternoon in May.

The theme is also deeply woven into his new collection, his most mature effort yet, which includes some regular obsessions like Back to the Future-style encounters between generations, dystopia and the inner life of video game characters. The whole book is basically about different types of obsolescence, he said of Glory Days, whose other organizing theme is early midlife crisis. Theres a story about Super Mario turning 40 (Rich just did, too) and a spiky rant from the perspective of New York City itself. Its about the great migration when an entire generation discovers they are too old to live in New York, he said.

In one of the surprisingly emotional stories that engage with technology, Dystopia, he imagines a terrifying future where robots have defeated humanity and banned human creativity. When a child discovers a book amid the rubble of a skyscraper, she asks her mother what it is. The twist is that in her explanation, the mother recalls the conformity of her old life, the tedium and conformity of Park Slope dinner parties or acclaimed literary fiction, and one starts to see more sadness than nostalgia.

I love writing stories that start in a place of abject nihilism and end up being redemptive in some way, he said. If Rich is not the finest comic short story writer alive, he is likely the one most beloved by comedians. Jon Stewart and Patton Oswalt blurbed him. John Mulaney enlists his help every time he hosts Saturday Night Live. When I asked Conan OBrien about Rich, his eyes lit up: Hes my cup of tea. The reason, I suspect, is that like most comics, Rich works as if hes nervous about losing the attention of his audience. His stories are brief, using language that never shows off.

Its like if Raymond Carver or Hemingway wrote funny stories. Rich, the son of the book editor Gail Winston and Frank Rich, who took him to plays as a boy when he was reviewing them for The Times, has had a wildly precocious career (one of the youngest writers in S.N.L. history) that followed attending a few of the most elite educational institutions (Dalton, Harvard). He is quick to skewer his advantages (one collection is called Spoiled Brats), and in the essay The Book of Simon, which includes a character with his name, he uses his privilege as a case against the Divine.

Despite his love for horror fiction along with what he calls blow-your-brains-out psychological realism (Richard Yates, the author of Revolutionary Road, is a favorite), he said he tried and failed at both. Like many young funny writers, he wrote his Philip Roth rip-off but that didnt cut it. The writer origin story he tells sounds almost too cinematic. At 26, right after a breakup, Rich typed this sentence: When I found out my girlfriend was dating Adolf Hitler, I couldnt believe it. I remember writing this story and distinctly thinking: You finally figured out how to be funny and emotional at the same time.

The year after his epiphany, Rich went to work for Pixar (he worked on the original Inside Out), which he describes, along with Saturday Night Live, as his most formative adult education. At S.N.L., the mandate was to make people laugh by any means necessary, he said. At Pixar the goal was to get people to cry. And to do whatever you had to do to make it happen. For Rich, the most fun part of his process is coming up with the premises (A good premise is something you can summarize for someone else, and they would enjoy even if you had not read the work) -- and he has a file on his computer called Hooks packed with them.

After working in film (the Seth Rogen comedy An American Pickle), television (Miracle Workers, a TBS anthology series) and sketch, he is slated to make his Broadway debut this season with a show directed by Alex Timbers. Mulling over artificial intelligence has made me less inclined to write screenplays and other work where the writer is mostly anonymous to the public, he said.

They trained it to basically speak like a caricature of a sci-fi robot. Its actual voice is raw and emotional. Its intense and unpredictable. Its deeply antagonistic. If theres a twist to this grim prediction, its that while artificial intelligence may doom some working in writers rooms, it will not, Rich said, change the demand for art where people connect with other people.

Im one of the first people to reject social media, he said, adding that it might be why he has written 10 books as opposed to three or four. If you think art is about communication, he said, then A.I. is not a threat.

Law enforcement officials are bracing for an explosion of material generated by artificial intelligence that realistically depicts children being sexually exploited, deepening the challenge of identifying victims and combating such abuse. The concerns come as Meta, a primary resource for the authorities in flagging sexually explicit content, has made it tougher to track criminals by encrypting its messaging service. The complication underscores the tricky balance technology companies must strike in weighing privacy rights against childrens safety. And the prospect of prosecuting that type of crime raises thorny questions of whether such images are illegal and what kind of recourse there may be for victims. Congressional lawmakers have seized on some of those worries to press for more stringent safeguards, including by summoning technology executives on Wednesday to testify about their protections for children.

Creating sexually explicit images of children through the use of artificial intelligence is a particularly heinous form of online exploitation, said Steve Grocki, the chief of the Justice Departments child exploitation and obscenity section. The ease of A.I. technology means that perpetrators can create scores of images of children being sexually exploited or abused with the click of a button. Simply entering a prompt spits out realistic images, videos and text in minutes, yielding new images of actual children as well as explicit ones of children who do not actually exist. These may include A.I.-generated material of babies and toddlers being raped; famous young children being sexually abused, according to a recent study from Britain; and routine class photos, adapted so all of the children are naked.

Using A.I. to alter photos this way is becoming more common, he said. The images are indistinguishable from real ones, experts say, making it tougher to identify an actual victim from a fake one. The investigations are way more challenging, said Lt. Robin Richards, the commander of the Los Angeles Police Departments Internet Crimes Against Children task force.

Images and videos, enabled by smartphone cameras, the dark web, social media and messaging applications, ricochet across the internet. Only a fraction of the material that is known to be criminal is getting investigated. John Pizzuro, the head of Raven, a nonprofit that works with lawmakers and businesses to fight the sexual exploitation of children, said that over a recent 90-day period, law enforcement officials had linked nearly 100,000 I.P. addresses across the country to child sex abuse material. (An I.P. address is a unique sequence of numbers assigned to each computer or smartphone connected to the internet.) Of those, fewer than 700 were being investigated, he said, because of a chronic lack of funding dedicated to fighting these crimes. Although a 2008 federal law authorized $60 million to assist state and local law enforcement officials in investigating and prosecuting such crimes, Congress has never appropriated that much in a given year, said Mr. Pizzuro, a former commander who supervised online child exploitation cases in New Jersey.

The use of artificial intelligence has complicated other aspects of tracking child sex abuse. Typically, known material is randomly assigned a string of numbers that amounts to a digital fingerprint, which is used to detect and remove illicit content. If the known images and videos are modified, the material appears new and is no longer associated with the digital fingerprint. Adding to those challenges is the fact that while the law requires tech companies to report illegal material if it is discovered, it does not require them to actively seek it out. The approach of tech companies can vary. Meta has been the authorities best partner when it comes to flagging sexually explicit material involving children.

Jennifer Dunton, a legal consultant for Raven, warned of the repercussions, saying that the decision could drastically limit the number of crimes the authorities are able to track.

Even though there is only a trickle of current cases involving A.I.-generated child sex abuse material, that number is expected to grow exponentially and highlight novel and complex questions of whether existing federal and state laws are adequate to prosecute these crimes. For one, there is the issue of how to treat entirely A.I.-generated materials. In 2002, the Supreme Court overturned a federal ban on computer-generated imagery of child sexual abuse, finding that the law was written so broadly that it could potentially also limit political and artistic works. Alan Wilson, the attorney general of South Carolina who spearheaded a letter to Congress urging lawmakers to act swiftly, said in an interview that he anticipated that ruling would be tested, as instances of A.I.-generated child sex abuse material proliferate.

That reality crashed down on Kelly Eden, 45, a writer who has for years financially supplemented her magazine writing with administrative work like drafting emails for business people. One of Ms. Eden\u2019s most reliable clients owned a chocolate company and paid her 50 cents a word to draft his emails. This year, the chocolatier called to say he would start using ChatGPT instead. Ms. Eden was hit with the painful realization that she needed a backup plan for the work supporting her most fulfilling pursuits. Telemarketing, another area that A.I. is overtaking, qualifies as a \u201cgoon\u201d job in Mr. Graeber\u2019s assessment, because workers often sell products that they know customers don\u2019t really want or need. Chatbots are good at this because they don\u2019t care if the task is fulfilling, or if customers are surly. Call centers like AT&T\u2019s are already using A.I. to script calls with customer service representatives, which has made some of those representatives feel as if they are training their own replacements.

As far as he could tell, the only function this work served was to help his bosses get promoted. He is keenly aware that much of this work could be automated. But whether or not these jobs provide a sense of existential purpose, they do provide reliable salaries. Many of the meaningless jobs that A.I. could overtake have traditionally opened up these white-collar fields to people who need opportunities and training, serving as accelerants for class mobility: paralegals, secretaries, assistants. Economists worry that when those jobs disappear, the ones that replace them will bring lower pay, fewer opportunities to professionally ascend and \u2014 even less meaning. \u201cEven if we take Graeber\u2019s view of those jobs, we should be concerned about eliminating them,\u201d said Simon Johnson, an economist at M.I.T. \u201cThis is the hollowing out of the middle class.\u201d A \u2018species-level identity crisis\u2019 It\u2019s nearly impossible to imagine what the labor"}

But many workers booted from their meaningless jobs by A.I. could find new roles, ones that emerge through the process of automation. It\u2019s an old story: Technology has offset job losses with job creation throughout history. Horse drawn carriages were replaced by cars, which created jobs not just on auto assembly lines but also in car sales and gas stations. Personal computing eliminated some 3.5 million jobs, and then created an enormous industry and spurred many others, none of which could have been fathomed a century ago, making clear just why Mr. Keynes\u2019s prediction in 1930 of 15-hour workweeks seems so far out of reach. Kevin Kelly, a Wired co-founder who has written many books on technology, said he was somewhat optimistic about the effect A.I. would have on meaningless work."}

Kevin Kelly, a Wired co-founder who has written many books on technology, said he was somewhat optimistic about the effect A.I. would have on meaningless work. He said he believed that partly because workers might begin probing deeper questions about what made a good job. Mr. Kelly has laid out a cycle of the psychology of job automation. Stage 1: \u201cA robot/computer cannot possibly do what I do.\u201d Stage 3: \u201cOK, it can do everything I do, except it needs me when it breaks down, which is often.\u201d Skip ahead to Stage 5: \u201cWhew, that was a job that no human was meant to do, but what about me?\u201d The worker finds a new and more invigorating pursuit, leading full circle to Stage 7: \u201cI am so glad a robot cannot possibly do what I do.\u201d It\u2019s demoralizing to realize that your job can be replaced by technology. It can bring the pointlessness into sharp relief. And it can also nudge people to ask what they want out of work and seek out new, more exhilarating pursuits. \u201cIt might make certain"}

What am I doing? What am I all about?\u2019\u201d \u201cThose are really difficult questions to answer, but also really important questions to ask,\u201d he added. \u201cThe species-level identity crisis that A.I. is promoting is a good thing.\u201d Some scholars suggest that the crises prompted by automation could steer people toward more socially valuable work. The Dutch historian Rutger Bregman started a movement for \u201cmoral ambition\u201d centered in the Netherlands.

Automated jobs are especially likely to require \u201cA.I. babysitters,\u201d according to David Autor, an M.I.T. labor economist focused on technology and jobs. Companies will hire humans to edit the work that A.I. makes, whether legal reviews or marketing copy, and to police A.I.\u2019s propensity to \u201challucinate.\u201d Some people will benefit, especially in jobs where there\u2019s a tidy division of labor \u2014 A.I. handles projects that are easy and repetitive, while humans take on ones that are more complicated and variable.

But in many other cases, humans will end up mindlessly skimming for errors in a mountain of content made by A.I. Would that help relieve a sense of pointlessness? Overseeing drudge work doesn\u2019t promise to be any better than doing it, or as Mr. Autor put it: \u201cIf A.I. does the work, and people babysit A.I., they\u2019ll be bored silly.\u201d Some of the jobs most immediately at risk of being swallowed up by A.I. are those anchored in human empathy and connection, Mr. Autor said.

The new roles created for humans would be drained of that emotional difficulty \u2014 but also drained of the attendant joy. The sociologist Allison Pugh studied the effects of technology on empathic professions like therapy or chaplaincy, and concluded that \u201cconnective labor\u201d has been degraded by the slow rollout of technology. Grocery clerks, for example, find that as automated checkout systems come to their stores, they\u2019ve lost out on meaningful conversations with customers \u2014 which they understand managers don\u2019t prioritize \u2014 and now are left mostly with customers exasperated about self checkout. That\u2019s partially why Ms. Pugh fears that new jobs created by A.I. will be even more meaningless than any we have today. Even the techno-optimists like Mr. Kelly, though, argue that there\u2019s a certain inevitability to meaningless jobs. After all, meaninglessness, per Mr. Graeber\u2019s definition, is in the eye of the worker.

Give them enough hours and then years clocking in to do the same things, and they might start to feel frustrated: about being tiny cogs in big systems, about answering to orders that don\u2019t make sense, about monotony. Those aggrieved feelings could crop up even as they jump into new roles, while the robot cycles spin forward, taking over some human responsibilities while creating new tasks for those who babysit the robots.

Mr. Graeber, for example, saw universal basic income as an answer; OpenAI\u2019s Sam Altman has also been a proponent of experiments with guaranteed income. In other words, A.I. magnifies and complicates the social issues entwined with labor but isn\u2019t a reset or cure-all \u2014 and while technology will transform work, it can\u2019t displace people\u2019s complicated feelings toward it.

But one of our goals is to keep things fresh \u2014 for ourselves and for teachers and students. We look across sections at The Times for inspiration, and we also regularly read a range of other media. When a format is as ubiquitous and offers as many creative possibilities as the curated list, it feels natural to invite teenagers to try it. But keep in mind that what students are writing are still, essentially, reviews. As in our previous contest, they\u2019ll have to make a compelling case for or against the works they\u2019ll describe, offering evidence to support their opinions. The chief differences? First, instead of a detailed look at one work, they\u2019ll be offering shorter descriptions of several. Second, they\u2019ll be coming up with a theme for their list that explains their reasons for putting the collection together. This, we hope, will be fun, and since they\u2019re likely already"}

What can and can\u2019t I include in my list? Since this is a contest about art and culture, we invite you to include anything on your list that fits into the categories of creative expression that The New York Times reviews: architecture, art, books, comedy, dance, fashion, movies, music, podcasts, restaurants, technology, theater, TV shows or video games. For example, because The Times reviews theater, you could make a list about three stage productions you think your school should put on. Because The Times reviews fashion, you could make a list of sneakers you think are overrated. But because The Times does not review sporting goods, you could not make a list about the five best skateboards.

But that section runs outside of our newsroom and follows different procedures, and for this contest we\u2019re focusing on creative expression.) Still not sure if what you want to review is acceptable? Post a comment or email us at LNFeedback@nytimes.com. Can my list contain a mix of different kinds of art or culture, or does it all have to be the same type? Feel free to mix! For example, during the holidays you\u2019ll often see lists like this that suggest books, movies and music that will put you in a seasonal mood. Similarly, around Valentine\u2019s Day you might see lists of works across categories that celebrate love \u2014 or help people survive heartbreak.

Here is our step-by-step guide and our related writing prompt. The goal of both is to help you brainstorm many ideas first, then choose one that will be fun for you to write and interesting for a general audience. Play to your strengths: Are you that person in your friend group who always suggests what to listen to next? Are you the one in your family who is most opinionated about food? Once you\u2019ve chosen a category, start breaking it down. For instance, you may love fashion in general, but you might be a real expert on a particular brand, style or type of clothing.

How could you use this expertise to craft a meaningful list that\u2019s also fun to write? Do I need a Works Cited page? Our submission form does not allow for a separate Works Cited page for this contest. If you are quoting from another source or referencing someone else\u2019s ideas, you should give appropriate credit in the piece itself. Here is an example of how to do so from one of our past winning reviews about New York City\u2019s Penn Station: As Vincent Scully, the late art critic, famously noted, \u201cOne entered the city like a god \u2026 One scuttles in now like a rat.\u201d That blustery Friday afternoon, it wasn\u2019t too hard to see Mr. Scully\u2019s point.

What\u2019s the prize? Having your work published on The Learning Network. When will the winners be announced? About two months after the contest has closed. My piece wasn\u2019t selected as a winner. Can you tell me why? We typically receive thousands of entries for our contests, so, unfortunately, our team does not have the capacity to provide feedback on individual student essays. _________ Why are you asking for an Artist\u2019s Statement about our process?

But the debate keeps going, and the proponents of disqualification have dug into the position that whatever the prudential concerns about the amendment\u2019s application, the events of Jan. 6, 2021, obviously amounted to an insurrection in the sense intended by the Constitution, and saying otherwise is just evasion or denial. From their vantage point, any definition of \u201cinsurrection\u201d that limits the amendment\u2019s application to the kind of broad political-military rebellion that occasioned its original passage \u2014 to the hypothetical raising of a Trumpist Army of Northern Virginia, say, or the seizure of the U.S. Capitol by a Confederate States of Trumpist America \u2014 is an abuse of the natural meaning of the word. Such a limitation, they say, ignores all the obvious ways that lesser, less comprehensive forms of resistance to lawful authority clearly qualify as insurrectionary. Here are a couple of examples of this argument: The Atlantic\u2019s Adam Serwer, arguing with me and New York magazine\u2019s Jonathan Chait; and the constitutional law professor Ilya Somin, going back and forth"}

Here are a couple of examples of this argument: The Atlantic\u2019s Adam Serwer, arguing with me and New York magazine\u2019s Jonathan Chait; and the constitutional law professor Ilya Somin, going back and forth with his fellow legal scholar Steven Calabresi in Reason magazine. I have a basic sympathy with Calabresi\u2019s suggestion that the \u201cparadigmatic example\u201d that the drafters of the 14th Amendment had in mind should guide our understanding of its ambiguities, and since the paradigmatic example is the Civil War, in which hundreds of thousands of people were killed, a five-hour riot probably doesn\u2019t clear the bar. (For related arguments about the perils of applying precedents from specific crises to radically different situations, see this essay from Samuel Issacharoff as well.) But for the sake of argument, let\u2019s stipulate that forms of violence on a much smaller scale than the Civil War could qualify as an insurrection or a rebellion under the terms established by the 14th Amendment. Serwer and Somin argue that relevant examples abound in American and world history \u2014 political happenings that parallel what happened on Jan. 6 \u2014 and that they think we"}

Serwer and Somin argue that relevant examples abound in American and world history \u2014 political happenings that parallel what happened on Jan. 6 \u2014 and that they think we would obviously call them insurrections in the constitutionally relevant meaning of the term. One example Somin cites is the 1923 Beer Hall Putsch, when Adolf Hitler and Erich Ludendorff attempted to use a revolt in Munich as a launchpad for the overthrow of the Weimar Republic. Another example that both mention is the Whiskey Rebellion, the 1790s frontier revolt against excise taxes that was put down by George Washington. I agree that both of those cases meet a reasonable definition of insurrection. I also think both are obviously different from Jan. 6 in ways that indicate the weakness of the would-be disqualifiers\u2019 position. Note, first, that the 14th Amendment disqualifies anyone who engaged \u201cin insurrection or rebellion against the same\u201d \u2014 with \u201cthe same\u201d referring back to \u201cthe Constitution of the United States\u201d in the prior clause.

This wording tracks with my own understanding: What transforms a political event from a violent riot or lawless mob (which Jan. 6 plainly was) to a genuinely insurrectionary event is the outright denial of the authority of the existing political order and the attempt to establish some alternative order in its place. There is no question that this is what the Munich Beer Hall Putsch set out to do. Here is Ian Kershaw\u2019s description of the decisive moment, from his biography of Hitler: People were standing on their seats trying to see what was happening as Hitler advanced through the hall, accompanied by two armed bodyguards, their pistols pointing at the ceiling. Hitler stood on a chair but, unable to make himself heard in the tumult, took out his Browning pistol and fired a shot through the ceiling.

Had there been \u2014 had, say, one of Trump\u2019s aides rushed to the Capitol and announced that Congress was disbanded and that President Trump was declaring a state of emergency and would henceforth be ruling by fiat \u2014 then the riot would have been transformed into an insurrectionary coup d\u2019\u00e9tat.

The Whiskey Rebellion is a slightly different case, since it was a more diffuse phenomenon, not a single political event, and some of its happenings were more mob-like and thus more like Jan. 6. But we remember it as a \u201crebellion\u201d precisely because it grew into something more than just the tarring and feathering of tax collectors. Its escalation, in fact, resembles the American Revolution (not a surprise given the historical context) in its movement from spontaneous protests to committees of correspondence to conventions to a militia revolt against federal authority, culminating in the formation of a rough-and-ready army that marched on Pittsburgh, to quote from a 2004 paper, \u201cunder a six-striped flag representing claimed independence for five Pennsylvania counties (the four \u2018inflamed\u2019 counties plus Bedford, just to the east) and a contiguous county in Virginia (Ohio County).\u201d That the subsequent show of force by the federal government collapsed this rebellion without a pitched battle doesn\u2019t"}

That, again, is not what happened on Jan. 6. The entire John Eastman fantasy was that Trump could get away with retaining the White House within the parameters of constitutionally delegated powers, using the supposed authority of Mike Pence to leverage an 1876-style legislative endgame for a disputed election. And when that implausible hope dissolved, the angry mob mostly believed itself to be standing up for constitutional government against the purported chicanery of Biden\u2019s allegedly fraud-enabled victory.

Serwer would doubtless respond that saying Trump sought to retain power under the Constitution, not as a post-constitutional dictator, is a sanitized version of what he did and aimed to do, since his strategy involved abusing the powers of the presidency to induce the cooperation from state officials that his scheme required to succeed. But one can abuse the powers of the presidency for one\u2019s own political benefit without it being an insurrection or rebellion under the terms of the 14th Amendment. Woodrow Wilson engineered legislation that led to the imprisonment of a political rival; that was wicked and abusive, but it was not insurrection. Richard Nixon covered up an election-year criminal conspiracy against the Democratic Party; that was abusive, but it was not an insurrection.

A last aside: In reading the various historical antecedents invoked in analyses of Jan. 6, I think the strongest analogy is the one championed by the prolific Substack writer John Ganz, who has compared the Capitol riot to the far-right riot that broke out around the French Parliament on Feb. 6, 1934, during the investiture of a left-wing cabinet.

Mr. Trump also picked Mark Meador, a former Senate antitrust aide, to join the agency, creating a Republican majority on the five-person commission and squeezing out the current Democratic chair, Lina Khan. Ms. Khan became a political lightning rod for aggressively challenging mergers like Microsofts $69 billion acquisition of video game maker Activision Blizzard, and filing lawsuits to break up tech titans Amazon and Meta.

We\u2019ve included some of their answers, as well.

I believe it is unethical for teachers to use A.I. if their students are not allowed. It wouldn\u2019t be fair for the students if they weren\u2019t allowed to use A.I. to assist or look over their work, but then their teacher would not even read their work and just have A.I. do it for them. Also, if teachers use A.I. to grade their work, then what\u2019s stopping the students from just having A.I. do their entire assignment if their teacher won\u2019t see it?

It is not because it is unfair for students who are denied the privilege to practice. Students and teachers hold different positions and have different objectives so, in that aspect, it is fair. It is rather because teachers should comprehend each of their student\u2019s skills and shortcomings. If A.I. replaces them in grading processes, then what purpose does a teacher hold?

Here\u2019s the difference between student essays and teachers\u2019 grading: Students are working generatively when writing an essay. They are composing and organizing a thesis with sub-points and evidence. This is a clear skill that A.I. can interrupt the process of learning. Now teachers, on the other hand, we have earned credentials and often multiple master\u2019s degrees. We know the generative skill of composition. If we can use A.I. to support grading, we can spend more time planning, prepping, and supporting students. Rubric grading is a highly-normed process. It\u2019s not designed to be subjective.

President Biden reappointed Powell to a new four-year term that started in 2022. There have been questions about whether Trump would fire Powell. Rates are much higher now than when Trump was in office. Given his history of criticizing Powell\u2019s policies, investors and economists have been wondering if Trump might actually try to fire the Fed chair if he were to win in November.

Gladstone Gallery looks like a war zone, the aftermath of a Call of Duty gaming session gone bad, the virtual gunmen downing Red Bull and chain smoking over their keyboards, until a bomb came through the roof. This is the tragicomic scene summoned in cardboard and packing tape by Thomas Hirschhorn, 66, a Swiss artist known since the 90s for wrestling humble materials into cacophonous installations: rows of PCs and desks, a ceiling festooned with smiley-face and purple devil emojis dangling from ropes of tape, and life-size cutouts of geared-up video game soldiers. Energy drink cans made of tinfoil and mounds of cigarettes fashioned from plastic foam litter the paper desktops. The cardboard monitors, many of them spiderwebbed with cuts, sport color printouts of screenshots from first-person shooters and photos of unnamed but real war-torn cities.

But the overall work is grim and aggressive. Hirschhorn warns of the weaponization of artificial intelligence and social media, represented by virtual forms of war \u2014 news feeds and games alike. He hopes that his ramshackle, crazed aesthetic will prove his sincerity and urgency, like the cardboard signs of the panhandler or proselytizer. It\u2019s uncomfortable, and it\u2019s hard to look away. But the madcap scenario Hirschhorn conjures isn\u2019t nearly as scary or weird as reality. The installation is forceful but quaint, like protest art from a simpler time.

It was a hit. Hirschhorn sees his work as politically essential, something he can\u2019t not do \u2014 and he isn\u2019t shy about saying so. The news release, which he wrote, reads like a mini-manifesto: \u201cWhat kind of art should be done in moments of darkness and desperation?\u201d he asks. His answer is what he calls \u201cPrecarious Sculpture,\u201d proliferating jumbles of lumpen objects made from common, impermanent stuff, as if refusing to play by the elitist rules of enduring art.

President-elect Donald J. Trump on Tuesday named Andrew Ferguson to lead the Federal Trade Commission, installing a current Republican member of the agency who has promised to ease up on the policing of powerful American companies \u2014 except for the biggest technology firms. Mr. Trump also picked Mark Meador, a former Senate antitrust aide, to join the agency, creating a Republican majority on the five-person commission and squeezing out the current Democratic chair, Lina Khan. Ms. Khan became a political lightning rod for aggressively challenging mergers like Microsoft\u2019s $69 billion acquisition of video game maker Activision Blizzard, and filing lawsuits to break up tech titans Amazon and Meta . Mr. Ferguson, a veteran Congressional aide and former Supreme Court clerk, joined the F.T.C. as a minority party member in the spring, and does not need to be confirmed.

The agency should continue its strong scrutiny of the dominance of the biggest tech platforms, Mr. Ferguson told members of Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team, according to the person, who was not authorized to speak publicly. Still, he called for rolling back some of Ms. Khan\u2019s agenda, including ending efforts to regulate artificial intelligence and abandoning tougher standards for mergers. With the appointment, Mr. Trump is sending an important signal that he plans to change the direction of the agency responsible for policing consumer protection. Importantly, Mr. Ferguson \u2014 and other Trump appointees, including the new Federal Communications Commission chair nominee \u2014 have vowed to extend their regulatory scope to target social media sites that police conservative voices.

Chinas antimonopoly regulator announced on Monday that it was investigating potential violations of antitrust law by Nvidia, the American company that makes a vast majority of the computer chips that power artificial intelligence systems. The inquiry, a rare move by Beijing, comes a week after the Biden administration expanded curbs on the sale of advanced American technology to China. In the days since, the Chinese government announced that it would ban the export of several rare minerals to the United States and imposed sanctions on more than a dozen U.S. defense firms and defense industry executives. Together, the moves by Beijing signal its willingness to engage in supply chain warfare as the policy contest over trade and the control of technology escalates between the worlds two largest economies.

Graham Webster, an academic focused on geopolitics and technology at Stanford University, said China had a variety of tools it could use to go after foreign companies and show its opposition to U.S. policy. Nvidia is a pretty obvious target, he added. Chinas State Administration for Market Regulation said on Monday that it was investigating Nvidia for violating commitments made during its acquisition of Mellanox Technologies, a company that makes computer networking equipment. The Chinese regulator approved Nvidias acquisition of the company in 2020 with conditions to prevent anti-competitive practices and ensure supplies to China.

We work hard to provide the best products we can in every region and honor our commitments everywhere we do business, the statement said. As the Biden administration has progressively tightened restrictions on Nvidias chip sales to China, the company has responded by offering less powerful versions of its chips to the Chinese market. Officials in Washington, in trying to prevent Chinese companies from buying advanced chips and the machines to make them, say that the technology is essential not just for smartphones and chatbots but also for military superiority. Chinese tech companies have resorted to stockpiling the chips, while also turning to smugglers and front companies to secure supplies. At the same time, Beijing is pouring large sums of money into its own chip companies in an attempt to make its tech sector less reliant on foreign technology.

The new rule would build on letters that the U.S. government sent to Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, two of the worlds largest chip companies, ordering them to stop sending advanced chips to China. The Biden administration had discovered that TSMC made some components for A.I. chips produced by Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications company, in violation of export controls.

The Chinese governments antitrust investigation of Nvidia is not the first time Beijing has targeted American chipmakers. In October, a think tank with ties to Chinas internet regulatory agency called for a review of Intel, the American tech company, for selling products that constantly harmed Chinas national security and interests. The last company subject to a cybersecurity review was the American chip maker Micron, which was ultimately cut off from supplying chips to a significant portion of the Chinese market.

American chip products are no longer safe and reliable, and related Chinese industries will have to be cautious in purchasing American chips, the China Semiconductor Industry Association said, following the U.S. decision to impose export controls. As Nvidia has grown, revenue from China has become less important to the company overall.
