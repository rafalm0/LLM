Since artificial intelligence \u201cannounced\u201d its arrival via ChatGPT, we\u2019ve been living through the dawn of the cognitive industrial revolution. A.I. promises a digital step change on par with past physical advancements in transport, logistics and manufacturing. In 2025 and beyond, we\u2019ll begin to feel the everyday impact of A.I. to amplify our human cognitive abilities. Some applications, such as personalized A.I. doctors or tutors with 24/7 access via smartphones, are obvious ways that A.I.\u2019s presence will be felt, given global needs and A.I.\u2019s current capabilities.

But a technology as profound as A.I. will also produce dramatic, surprising innovations that will only seem obvious with the benefit of hindsight. I believe in the entrepreneurial spirit and the market forces of consumer adoption to push innovation forward, but I also believe that advancing A.I. is a moral imperative due to the host of planetary-level challenges that humans have thus far failed to sufficiently address. Therefore, I believe it is incumbent on us to use A.I. to expand human abilities to solve our most pressing problems \u2014 from climate change and disease eradication to expanding access to opportunity. And so, I see supporting the continued development and adoption of A.I. as a goal in itself. This moral imperative applies on cascading levels.

Instead of being similar to how I own \u201cmy clothes\u201d or \u201cmy car,\u201d data ownership should reflect the reality of abundance. Akin to our adaptation of copyright to enable fair use, we must collaborate on a new version of copyright for our data era that both protects people\u2019s rights and enables economic growth.

A.I. is the defining technology of our lifetime \u2014 and probably any lifetime. In just a few years, we\u2019ve already witnessed three generations of A.I. First came predictive models that analyze data. Next came generative A.I., driven by deep-learning models like ChatGPT. Now, we are experiencing a third wave \u2014 one defined by intelligent agents that can autonomously handle complex tasks. These agents have the potential to augment human capabilities in ways previously unimaginable. Agentforce, Salesforce\u2019s suite of A.I. agents, is leading this third wave.

Imagine a world where businesses can deploy an A.I. work force of agents to manage customer interactions, analyze data, optimize sales strategies and execute operational tasks in real time and with little human supervision. This capability could boost a company\u2019s productivity and allow employees to focus on higher-value work, fostering innovation, creativity and customer relationships. Agentforce\u2019s goal is to augment every employee, deepen customer relations and increase growth and profit margins. This collaboration between humans and A.I. agents, which combines human creativity and critical thinking with A.I.\u2019s precision and scalability, will form the cornerstone of the future workplace. At Salesforce, we envision deploying more than 1 billion A.I. agents for our customers by the end of 2025. The arrival of A.I. agents is an extraordinary moment for the global economy.

The \u201970s are this breakpoint between one era in our economy and our government and our society and our vision for the future and the next. The \u201970s are when economic inequality really begins rising, when the environmental movement takes off, when a huge amount of legislation is passed in response to the harms of all the building and growth that had happened since the New Deal. But there\u2019s this tendency to look at the places that legislation goes too far and to say, well, if we hadn\u2019t made all these dumb mistakes, everything would be great. We\u2019d be richer.

This skill can then be applied to your daily life.

And so the way it understood her was really around this striking copper hair. She is, as she put it, a haircut.

But then you go 30 days longer, and you have a million. Then you wait another 30 days. Now you have a billion. That\u2019s the power of the exponential curve. Growth feels normal for a while.

Proponents claim that artificial intelligence will eliminate acts of mental drudgery, freeing us to become our best selves. Detractors worry not just that it will eliminate well-paying knowledge sector jobs and increase inequality but also that it will effectively steal the human soul. Once computers can produce songs and shows, paintings and poems indistinguishable from the work of living hands, the last remnants of human exceptionalism will be snuffed out.

In its efforts to tear down the myth of human creativity, these thinkers received support from a surprising place. For more than a generation, the primary intellectual alternative to the various strains of Marx-inflected critical theory has been a highly rationalized, neo-Darwinist scientific materialism with roots in the gene-centered view of evolution that emerged at the same time that Barthes and his peers were kicking off the critical turn.

Some were bleary-eyed -- most hefted briefcases -- as they checked bags and made their way to the security screening lines. It was business as usual, until some approached a line that was almost empty. One by one, they walked to a kiosk with an iPad affixed to it and had their photos taken, as a security officer stood by. Within seconds, each passengers image was matched to a photo from a government database, and the traveler was ushered past security into the deeper maze of the airport.

Time-consuming airport rituals like security screening, leaving your luggage at bag drop and even boarding a plane may soon only require your face, helping to reduce waiting times and stress for travelers, Mr. Harteveldt said.

Gladstone Gallery looks like a war zone, the aftermath of a Call of Duty gaming session gone bad, the virtual gunmen downing Red Bull and chain smoking over their keyboards, until a bomb came through the roof. This is the tragicomic scene summoned in cardboard and packing tape by Thomas Hirschhorn, 66, a Swiss artist known since the 90s for wrestling humble materials into cacophonous installations: rows of PCs and desks, a ceiling festooned with smiley-face and purple devil emojis dangling from ropes of tape, and life-size cutouts of geared-up video game soldiers. Energy drink cans made of tinfoil and mounds of cigarettes fashioned from plastic foam litter the paper desktops.

Demand for solar power is expected to grow astronomically over the next decade thanks to the plummeting costs of panels, hundreds of billions of dollars in federal subsidies and growing interest from tech companies in securing carbon-free electricity for their data centers. By some estimates, the country will need 475,000 solar workers by 2033, nearly double todays number. Yet 44 percent of solar companies already say it is very difficult to find qualified workers, according to one recent survey. It can be especially hard to recruit construction workers for large solar arrays, which are often located in remote desert areas. The job involves lifting and installing hundreds of panels per day, each one weighing 60 pounds or more, in places where temperatures can reach in excess of 110 degrees Fahrenheit, or about 43 Celsius."}

The Justice Department asked for a federal judge to break up Google over its monopoly in search. And the Commerce Department is racing to grant more than $80 billion to chip manufacturers and companies bringing broadband to American homes . Regulators say the activity is intended to tie up loose ends on cases the incoming Trump administration may not continue. Last-minute victories would also burnish what they view as a Democratic legacy of putting Silicon Valley on its heels. \u201cRegulators are worried efforts they\u2019ve made will come to a screeching halt,\u201d said Jessica Gonz\u00e1lez, co-chief executive of Free Press, a nonpartisan nonprofit media and tech public interest group.

Artificial intelligence technology has drastically simplified the creation of images of children being exploited or abused, whether real or fake. Law enforcement officials are bracing for an explosion of material generated by artificial intelligence that realistically depicts children being sexually exploited, deepening the challenge of identifying victims and combating such abuse. The concerns come as Meta, a primary resource for the authorities in flagging sexually explicit content, has made it tougher to track criminals by encrypting its messaging service. The complication underscores the tricky balance technology companies must strike in weighing privacy rights against childrens safety. And the prospect of prosecuting that type of crime raises thorny questions of whether such images are illegal and what kind of recourse there may be for victims. Congressional lawmakers have seized on some of those worries to press for more stringent safeguards, including by summoning technology executives on Wednesday to testify about their protections for children.

The ease of A.I. technology means that perpetrators can create scores of images of children being sexually exploited or abused with the click of a button. Simply entering a prompt spits out realistic images, videos and text in minutes, yielding new images of actual children as well as explicit ones of children who do not actually exist.

I\u2019ve writtenseveraltimes about the case for disqualifying Donald Trump via the 14th Amendment, arguing that it fails tests of political prudence and constitutional plausibility alike. But the debate keeps going, and the proponents of disqualification have dug into the position that whatever the prudential concerns about the amendment\u2019s application, the events of Jan. 6, 2021, obviously amounted to an insurrection in the sense intended by the Constitution, and saying otherwise is just evasion or denial. From their vantage point, any definition of \u201cinsurrection\u201d that limits the amendment\u2019s application to the kind of broad political-military rebellion that occasioned its original passage \u2014 to the hypothetical raising of a Trumpist Army of Northern Virginia, say, or the seizure of the U.S. Capitol by a Confederate States of Trumpist America \u2014 is an abuse of the natural meaning of the word. Such a limitation, they say, ignores all the obvious ways that lesser, less comprehensive forms of resistance to lawful authority clearly qualify as insurrectionary.

(For related arguments about the perils of applying precedents from specific crises to radically different situations, see this essay from Samuel Issacharoff as well.)

Another example that both mention is the Whiskey Rebellion, the 1790s frontier revolt against excise taxes that was put down by George Washington.

Trumponomics and the Fed One of the hot debates on Wall Street this election cycle is how Donald Trump would deal with the Fed if he is re-elected and, in particular, if he would fire or demoteJay Powell as chair, The Times\u2019s Jeanna Smialek writes for DealBook. In an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek conducted before last weekend\u2019s assassination attempt, Trump said that he did not plan to fire Powell, allowing him to serve out his term. But he also added some drama by making the statement conditional, saying that he would keep Powell on \u201cespecially if I thought he was doing the right thing.\u201d That said, it\u2019s not clear that Trump could legally fire Powell even if he wanted to, but Trump\u2019s phrasing seemed to imply that he believed he had a choice.

Rates are much higher now than when Trump was in office. Given his history of criticizing Powell\u2019s policies, investors and economists have been wondering if Trump might actually try to fire the Fed chair if he were to win in November. Trump still wants low rates, eventually. Asked to describe his philosophy for the economy, Trump talked about \u201clow interest rates and taxes.\u201d But there\u2019s a hitch: The Fed sets rates independently of the White House.

Gladstone Gallery looks like a war zone, the aftermath of a Call of Duty gaming session gone bad, the virtual gunmen downing Red Bull and chain smoking over their keyboards, until a bomb came through the roof. This is the tragicomic scene summoned in cardboard and packing tape by Thomas Hirschhorn, 66, a Swiss artist known since the 90s for wrestling humble materials into cacophonous installations: rows of PCs and desks, a ceiling festooned with smiley-face and purple devil emojis dangling from ropes of tape, and life-size cutouts of geared-up video game soldiers.

Some experts believe that this will be the year that biometric use, primarily facial recognition, becomes standard at many airports.
