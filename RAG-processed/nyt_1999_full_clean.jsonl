''We face serious challenges,'' said Mark Bohr, an Intel technology development director and the co-author of an internal Intel technical paper that enumerates the company's unsolved problems. ''We all have ideas to address some of these problems and admittedly they are iffy and not fully developed, and you don't want to tip your cards too soon.'' And Carver Mead, a physicist and a pioneer in semiconductor design, says he still adheres to what has been the conventional industry wisdom, suggesting that Moore's Law will continue to account for the pace of silicon technology advances until at least 2014. ''There are still some open issues,'' he said. ''and so the Chicken Little sky-is-falling articles are a recurring theme.'' But James Heath, a chemistry professor at the University of California at Los Angeles who is a co-inventor of the carbon 60 molecule known as the Buckyball, said the industry might be overly optimistic because it had such a vast investment in today's silicon technology."}

''I think their optimism for being able to continue until 2014 is not very realistic,'' he said. ''When you get to very, very small sizes, you are limited by relying on only a handful of electrons to describe the difference between on and off.'' Executives at I.B.M., which along with Intel and Motorola is one of the nation's dominant chip makers, acknowledged that it might be accurate to warn of an impending limit to the shrinking of today's dominant chips, known as C.M.O.'s, or complimentary metal oxide semiconductors."}
