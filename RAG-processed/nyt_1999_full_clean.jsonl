That wave hit corporate America as a whole in 1999, when companies large and small recognized that the impact of the Internet would not be confined merely to Silicon Valley or to the proliferating dot-com start-ups. Every business now knows that it faces the opportunity and threat of being transformed by the Internet, and this was the year that happened, said Daniel Yergin, a business consultant and author. The Internet has also become a powerful symbol of societys expectations about the future -- a future of fast-moving, disruptive technology that is shifting the terrain not only in business, but also in politics and culture. The truth, of course, is that it is probably too early to judge whether an Internet revolution is truly under way. Historians say the Internet should be viewed mainly as the latest advance in communications, a successor to the telegraph and the telephone, more a technological step than a leap forward.

When people speak of the Internet economy, they do not really mean that Internet businesses themselves suddenly loom so large in the nations $9 trillion economy. They are talking of a technology and a pattern of business behavior that feels like the future. The Internet is seen as a technology of borderless free markets. It is a global network with open technology standards, not owned or controlled by a single company or nation. And it is magic on Wall Street these days, driving the shares of many Internet companies to astronomical heights. Because it is such a low-cost communications technology, the Internet holds the promise of drastically reducing transactions costs.

At Novells annual users group meeting today in Provo, Utah, the company plans to demonstrate a simple personal computer version of the Digital Me software, which acts as a digital safe-deposit box for personal information -- not only name, address, credit card numbers and such, but also possibly the telltale electronic codes that can identify a persons PC and be used to trace his or her Web travels.

After reviewing the privacy practices of World Wide Web sites, the commission told Congress that the industry had fallen far short of what is needed to protect consumers. Only a tiny fraction of Web sites, the F.T.C. noted, told people what the sites did with the personal information they collected -- names, E-mail addresses, credit card numbers. Even fewer sites offered consumers any choice about how their personal data were used, allowed them to access the data or gave assurances of its security. Industry self-regulation, the F.T.C. concluded, was not working. Its scathing report increased the chances that Congress would enact sweeping Internet privacy legislation. And the findings hardened resolve in Europe to reject the American self-regulatory approach to privacy on line, a dispute that threatened to escalate into the first Internet trade war. Christine Varney, the commissions Internet expert until she left in August 1997, had long warned the industry that if it did not move to shoulder responsibility on privacy, the Government would surely step in.

Microsoft in effect conceded that the feature, a unique identifying number used by Windows and other Microsoft products, had the potential to be more invasive than a traceable serial number in the Intel Corporations new Pentium III computer chip that has privacy advocates up in arms. The difference is that the Windows number is tied to an individuals name, to identifying numbers on the hardware in his computer and even to documents that he creates. The combination of the Windows number with all these data, the privacy advocates said, could result in the ability to track a single user and the documents he created across vast computer networks. Hackers could compromise the resulting data base, or subpoenas might allow authorities to gain access to information that would otherwise remain private and unavailable.

There was hype about Web pads -- handy, wireless slates for surfing the Web, in effect portable computers with screen but without keyboard. And there was more hype about Internet appliances, which are devices other than computers that provide Web access. Even William H. Gates, the Microsoft chairman who is high priest of the PC, took time out from his presentation to showcase what he called a Web companion, a computer that eschews the Windows operating system in gaining access to the Web.

Most of those journalists had been forced to watch the 78 days of bombing through the lenses of official video cameras and wanted to see things for themselves. Almost anywhere you point the camera you find a story, said Bill Wheatley, NBCs vice president for news. The wave of images of Serbian tanks departing and ethnic Albanians returning is only the latest to show the paroxysm of Kosovo. From the terror of airborne high- technology bombing to the terror of the Serb military campaign, the conflict has produced war coverage that, according to editors, correspondents and media critics, was in some basic ways different from any battlefield coverage that had come before. There was both more censorship -- and more information. Military censors racheted up controls during the bombing but satellite communications allowed reporters from Brussels to Kukes, Albania, to triangulate information more easily than in earlier conflicts.

Cable news channels offered high-decibel debate, though some people contend that the formats permitted little nuance or textured argument. On the Internet, a profusion of Web sites provided perspectives on the conflict from any angle one could want: Serb, Albanian, Republican, Democratic, from the depth of the BBC to the passionate nationalism of the Belgrade-based newspaper Politika.

Mr. Davis said the company had been too busy expanding other departments to focus much on technology in those days. Given its relatively late start, Merrill has made a respectable showing this year.

As part of its Web push, Bertelsmann, which is based in Guetersloh, Germany, also hopes to make Internet access more affordable in Europe, where users complain bitterly about having to pay not only for connection time but also a separate rate for use of the underlying telephone line. Within the next few months, Mr. Middelhoff said last week, the company plans to switch to a package of fixed monthly rates for subscribers of America Online Inc.s Europe operation, in which Bertelsmann owns a 50 percent stake.

Like leading firms in many industries, Merrill has been struggling to find a way to compete with cheaper on-line upstarts. From bookstores to travel agencies, companies must decide how much to risk their existing large and profitable businesses in order to do battle with small, unprofitable but rapidly growing Internet competitors. Merrill, which has more brokers and assets than any other such firm, has for years held the line, arguing that customers would be willing to pay its higher fees for superior service and in-depth analysis. But ultimately it decided that Internet trading was neither a fad nor a small segment of the market.

But those customers will not get access to research or guidance from a broker. Alternately, customers can pay an annual fee of at least $1,500 for unlimited trading and advice, either on line or through a broker.

In high school, he volunteered to spend afternoons picking up trash along a nearby river. At Princeton University, he read books by radical environmentalists and stayed up late discussing how to save the earth. Then he joined the family business as a vehicle-planning analyst in 1979, and got a shock when he tried to raise environmental concerns. Coming to an old-line auto company, people looked at me like I was a Bolshevik for bringing it up, for even asking the questions, he said.

The question, posed by economists, is whether the higher productivity growth averaging about 2 percent in the last three years, roughly double the pace from 1973 to 1995, is the long-awaited confirmation that the nations steadily rising investment in computers and communications is finally paying off.

The phenomenon, known as Moores Law for the semiconductor pioneer who first observed it, has been the basic force underlying the computer revolution and the rise of the Internet. As transistors have been scaled ever smaller, computing performance has risen exponentially while the cost of that power has been driven down. And it has been assumed in the industry that the rate of progress would hold for at least another 10 to 15 years. But now a researcher at Intel, the worlds leading chip company, has reported glimpsing a potentially insurmountable barrier to the advance of Moores Law much closer at hand, perhaps early in the coming decade.

On what grounds? Because Goldman had advised an investor in Orange of Britain, a wireless company Mannesmann itself wanted. But the court called the suit hopeless, refusing to censure Goldman for having too many of a good thing -- clients. In the end, the episode underscored what investment bankers had known all along: Goldman Sachs had become a dominant force in the redrawing of Europes telecommunications map.

That represents an almost fourfold increase over 1998, according to Thompson Financial Securities Data, and enough to propel it from No. 11 to No. 1 on the list of bankers in European telecommunications mergers. Not only is Goldman the lead adviser for the voracious Vodafone, Britains largest wireless concern, but it acts as counsel to other giants, most notably Deutsche Telekom, which Goldman took public in 1996. This rise to prominence has come at the expense of European investment bankers like Lazard Freres & Company and Schroders, Britains largest independent investment bank. They have not only fallen behind Goldman on their own turf but know that its most formidable opponent in the region is another American firm, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Company. But the European bankers face more than bad luck. In a year when American-style corporate takeovers are overrunning the traditions of economic nationalism in Europe -- a few years ago, a hostile bid by a British company for a German telecommunications company would have been unthinkable -- the contestants need the American banks that know best how to play the game.

Paul Maritz, the highest-ranking executive appearing as a witness at the Microsoft antitrust trial, portrayed the discussions with the Netscape Communications Corporation in 1995 as mainly an effort to find common ground between the two companies. But the Government maintains that a June 1995 meeting was a crucial episode in its sweeping antitrust case. After Netscape rejected Microsofts proposal, the Government contends, Microsoft embarked on what the prosecution regards as a pattern of practices intended to thwart competition. David Boies, the Justice Departments lead trial lawyer, presented several Microsoft E-mails written shortly before the Netscape meeting saying that Microsoft wanted to make sure Netscapes software for browsing the World Wide Web did not become a technology platform for which software programmers would write applications -making it a potential alternative to Microsofts industry-standard Windows operating system.

But in some of the sharpest questioning since the trial began last October, Mr. Boies persistently asked an elusive Mr. Maritz about the implications of Microsofts proposal. If Netscape had agreed to shift its focus away from software that Microsoft deemed mainstream to its strategic interests, he asked, would Netscape have become a less significant platform threat? That, Mr. Maritz conceded, was partly true. At one level, yes, he said.

That was five years ago. At the time, Japan was aghast at the idea of freeing up a market that was a groggy backwater. Japanese citizens were not even allowed to own cellular phones -- just rent them -- and Japanese companies were afraid that they were going to lose business to American rivals like Motorola. Yet Japan buckled, and now, under the pressure of competition, it has leap-frogged to the front of the global pack. The country now has a higher concentration of cellular telephones -- including ones colored pink, pale blue or tea-green -- than does the United States. More astonishing, Japan has caught up with Europe, the early pace setter, and plans to move ahead in 2001 by introducing the third generation of cellular phone technology, which promises much greater clarity and ability to transmit data and video.

Moreover, as in Europe, they have leaped into the digital era under the umbrella of compatibility -- unlike in the United States, where competing technologies have actually stifled the advance of seamless and ubiquitous communication. The latest mobile phone to draw oohs and aahs here has a tiny camera that sends a shaky TV-style color image to a small screen on the other partys telephone -- assuming that it too is a video phone.

While its revenue has declined, profit margins have increased recently, not fallen. CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES THURSDAY OCTOBER 28, 1999 AT&T, the nations most widely held stock, posted quarterly results yesterday that exceeded analysts expectations and underscored the increasing importance in the communications industry of new services at the expense of traditional products. AT&Ts earnings beat estimates by a penny a share, but the companys overall profit declined largely because of a dilution of its stock caused by the acquisition of Tele-Communications Inc., the cable TV giant. Strong growth in the AT&T units that provide wireless phone service and that serve the complex communication needs of big businesses was largely offset by continued declines in the companys core consumer long-distance business. Over all, AT&T demonstrated healthy revenue growth, especially compared with anemic revenue performance in recent years. But it was not able to maintain the pace of revenue growth it established in the second quarter, and the company still appears to be growing less quickly than the rest of the telecommunications industry,"}

The latest figures from the hotel industry, covering the first nine months of this year, show that occupancy rates are still in decline, continuing a trend that began in 1997. In fact, occupancy through September 1999 was down from the same period last year in 17 of the nations 25 biggest markets, according to Smith Travel Research, the scorekeeper for the United States hotel industry. And industry analysts project falling occupancy for each of the next two years. But dont be lulled into thinking that it is now easier to book the room of your choice at the last minute, or that room rates will plummet to reflect lower demand. The nine-month occupancy rate, 65.2 percent, is still slightly above the 25-year industry average of 65 percent. And unless you are willing to stay in the boondocks or at the Hotel Last Resort, city-center hotels, luxury and full service hotels may be as tough as ever to get into, while room rates, which have averaged $81.06 so far in 1999, are likely to continue rising."}

Furthermore, the slippage in those cities has ranged from less than 2 percent in Minneapolis-St. Paul (1.7 percent, to be exact) to a minuscule 0.1 percent in Philadelphia.

Delta 3 is one of the leaders in the still-developing field known as Internet telephony -- a technique for carrying phone calls using Internet systems that whatever the sound quality so far, can be more efficient than traditional telephone networks. Many analysts expect Internet technology to become one of the main means for carrying phone calls as more communications companies focus their networks on Internet-based data, audio and video applications. In order to attract eyeballs and to provide more products and services, we decided to give Delta 3 the ability to do financing on their own, Itzhak Fisher, RSLs chief executive, said on Friday. RSL, which is registered in Bermuda but has its operating headquarters in New York, is a small but fast-growing company focused on selling international communications to small and medium-sized business customers.

In the past, transmitting international phone calls using Internet technology was profitable because carriers could avoid the high tariffs levied by many foreign countries on traditional phone calls. The arbitrage between high tariffs on normal phone calls and no or low tariffs on Internet communications enabled Internet-based companies to undercut traditional carriers and still make money. Sensing this opportunity, RSL acquired a controlling stake in Delta 3 in 1997 and the entire company last year.

The new goal is to become an integrated provider of voice communications over the World Wide Web.

The trial is by no means over, but it will sharply shift gears as the daily theater in the courtroom gives way to a more sober weighing of facts and law. Now the showmanship ends and the legal maneuvering really begins, said Andrew I. Gavil, a Howard University law professor.

Ciscos briefing will be the first detailed plans to follow an announcement last month by the company, Motorola and 10 other equipment makers and service providers who said they would create an industry-standard format for sending Internet data over a long-existing, little-used set of microwave frequencies.

But the commission has also set aside wireless frequencies in a band called the Unlicensed National Information Infrastructure. This second, unlicensed frequency band is meant to encourage experimental uses of the airwaves without the expense of buying or applying for licenses. Because Ciscos technology will also work with this unlicensed band, the company predicts that smaller Internet service providers and communications companies will be able to quickly enter and compete in the market for high-speed -- or broad band -- Internet access at relatively low cost.

In public, he sometimes stands stiffly and smiles only slightly. He bows often to emphasize his humility. Moreover, he lives in Tokyo, the risk-averse capital of the world, where the Internet is still a foreign concept to many. But if there is such a thing as an Internet financial and media empire, Mr. Sons company, Softbank, may be it. Mr. Son, 41, and Softbank are already among the most powerful financial forces in cyberspace, controlling key stakes in 100 Internet information providers in the United States and 20 such companies in Japan. The stakes in publicly held companies, worth $15 billion to $20 billion, are sprinkled widely. Softbank now owns 28 percent of Yahoo, and it has important stakes in Geocities, E-Loans, E*Trade, USWeb, Message Media, and TheStreet.com. And Softbank is intensifying its focus on the Internet with new deals all the time. Last Tuesday, for example, it agreed"}

But while Mr. Son is Japans leading entrepreneur, the oddity, and perhaps the reason, is that he is not ethnically Japanese. A Chinese-Korean, he grew up poor in southern Japan, closed off from normal avenues in Japans corporate world because of discrimination against the Korean minority.

Their arrival, the companies supporting the Bluetooth technology say, will signal the beginning of the personal-area network. Bluetooth, which is the creation of a consortium of computer and communications companies -- Ericsson, I.B.M., Toshiba, Nokia and Intel -- was conceived two years ago as a way to eliminate the tangle of cables that plague device-happy computer users. It has since evolved from a way to reduce last-minute trips to Radio Shack for that missing nine-pin serial connector into a technology for a broad range of wireless applications. Bluetooth works by allowing high-speed communication among devices that are within 33 feet of one another. While some current mobile devices can communicate through infrared signals, those signals must have a clear, straight path from one device to the other. Bluetooth, in contrast, operates on a radio frequency, so its signals can penetrate walls and briefcases. That means an electronic organizer in your pocket could transmit a phone number to the cell phone in your briefcase and initiate a phone call -- all part"}

Some employees may leaf through plan summaries or peruse health-care provider directories to make their choices, but at an increasing number of companies, employees are doing things differently. These tasks are, or soon will be, completed electronically, from the desktop at the click of a mouse, and by the people getting the benefits, not by human resource departments. At the Oracle Corporation, the Boeing Company and Charles Schwab & Company, for example, workers surf internal corporate computer networks and Web sites set up by benefit providers to check their 401(k) account balances, switch health-care plans or update W-4 forms, all tasks that were once exclusively the job of human resources employees.

Employers embrace the notion as a way to automate their human resources departments, cutting costs and increasing efficiency. Employees either like it or hate it. Some find it empowering to be able to see their files and change their choices. But others find it frustrating to be left to sort out the merits of an insurance plan on their own, trying to decipher the coverage limits described on an insurers Web site without the benefit of a human being to help explain them. That inherent tension leads some observers to question whether low-tech human assistance is better than high-tech self-help in the area of employee benefits, or in at least some parts of the benefits process.

There were only two nodes on what was then known as the Arpanet, the precursor to the Internet built by the Defense Departments Advanced Research Projects Agency. As the story has become enshrined in the folklore, a U.C.L.A. student named Charley Kline tapped out the letters l and o, which were dutifully echoed back by a computer at the Stanford Research Institute, a center about 300 miles northwest in what was not yet Silicon Valley. When he typed the third letter, g, the S.R.I. computer was supposed to recognize and complete the full command. Instead, the letters caused a memory buffer to overflow, bringing down the system.

The S.R.I. computer had to be fooled into thinking it was talking to a regular old teletype machine, a virtual user, which might as well have been in the same room. Stanford had practiced for the occasion by running simulations of the network connection. But there is no substitute for the real thing. Quite a bit of thought went into debugging the initial network connection, Mr. Duvall recalled. When the S.R.I. end came up, I was pretty happy.

The 328-page testimony by Richard L. Schmalensee of M.I.T. is a sweeping rebuttal to the Justice Departments two-and-a-half-month attempt to prove that Microsoft used its monopoly in personal computer operating system software to thwart competitive challenges posed by therise of the Internet. The Governments case, Mr. Schmalensee wrote in his direct testimony, amounts to speculation based on a morass of E-mails from Microsoft executives that at first glance may seem damaging, but are not. Forget the atmospherics, he tells the court, and focus on the outcome -- what he insists is a lack of measurable harm, current or future, to consumers from Microsofts business practices.

Proper economic inquiry into whether a company is engaged in anticompetitive conduct should end if it concludes that consumers have not been harmed by the conduct at issue and are not likely to be harmed in the future, Mr. Schmalensee wrote. High and rising product prices are typically the litmus test of whether a monopolist has the power to punish competitors and gouge consumers. The Governments evidence shows that Microsoft has increased the price it charges personal computer makers for its Windows operating system in recent years, even as the prices of other components of computer systems have declined. Still, the cost of Windows accounts for less than 5 percent of the price of a typical personal computer -- not really evidence of the kind of price-gouging normally associated with a monopolist, as some economists have noted. But the Governments case is focused as much on the future as on the recent past. If Microsoft is allowed to continue to thwart competition, the Justice Department says, consumers will surely suffer from less product choice, less innovation and higher prices in the long run.

Qtera is developing technology that allows fiber optic lines to carry signals farther than they usually do now without regeneration. Generally, optic signals that are carrying billions of bits a second must now be regenerated every 250 to 375 miles, analysts said. When the optical signals are regenerated, they are usually converted into electrical signals, then amplified and reconverted into pulses of light.

For Mr. Robertson, who is widely regarded as one of the best investment managers of his time, the humbling comedown is perhaps the most dramatic reversal of recent memory in the money management business -- not only because Tiger has lagged severely behind the broad stock market over the last 15 months, but also because its previous record was so dazzling. The loss of capital -- from both investor withdrawals and investments -- has made Mr. Robertson, a 67-year-old billionaire who in recent years has started spreading some of his wealth to philanthropies like Lincoln Center, intent on righting the firm before he retires.

Last weeks casualty may have been the Comcast Corporation, the big cable television operator. Just when it looked as if AT&T had settled down to manage its own $31.8 billion acquisition of Tele-Communications Inc., the No. 2 cable carrier, Mr. Armstrong swam into the middle of Comcasts pending $53 billion deal for the Mediaone Group and roiled the waters with an unsolicited bid for AT&T to buy Mediaone for $58 billion.

The main question for AT&T now is whether its appetite has exceeded its ability to integrate its businesses into the lean yet powerful communications machine that Mr. Armstrong wants AT&T to become. As Mr. Armstrong propels AT&T headlong into the future he has envisioned, the company faces mounting challenges -- not only of management and strategy, but also of regulation and technology. Perhaps the most daunting management challenge for AT&T is the sheer breadth of Mr. Armstrongs strategic ambition.

Usually, they aim their sharpest invective at giants like the Microsoft Corporation and I.B.M. or top executives at those companies. But lately, Lawrence J. Ellison, chairman and chief executive of Oracle, and his lieutenants have directed their scorn at two little-known neighbors in Silicon Valley: Siebel Systems Inc. and Ariba Inc. Why has Oracle, the No. 2 software company in the world behind Microsoft, directed shots at two tiny rivals? In a word, growth. In its third quarter, Oracle reported that sales of its applications, which big companies use to manage accounting, personnel and manufacturing processes, grew 5 percent, down from 19 percent in the second quarter. Sales of Oracle data base software, which keeps track of all of an enterprises transactions like sales, inventory levels and records, grew 10 percent, down from 26 percent in the second quarter.

The device, which Cisco calls a virtual switch controller, is based on Internet technology and is meant to augment or replace existing communications switches made by companies including Northern Telecom Ltd. of Canada and Ericsson A.B. of Sweden. But it is Lucent Technologies Inc., invigorated by its recent $20 billion deal to acquire Ascend Communications Inc., that Cisco has identified as its main competition.

Those pieces, known as packets, can then share a common communications pipeline, only to be reassembled into intelligible messages at their destination. By agreeing to buy Ascend, Ciscos closest competitor in the data communications market, Lucent took a big step to beef up its Internet-based offerings. The real significance is that circuit-switching is a very limited technology and a proprietary technology, Donald J.

Think of the Deerslayer, Davy Crockett, Amelia Earhart, Clint Eastwood. At times, though, the stereotype has failed to ring true; in truth, individualism has run in pronounced cycles. Just in the last 50 years, it was precisely the lack of individualism that prompted William H. Whytes Organization Man and David Riesmans Lonely Crowd, best sellers articulating public concern about the dangers of conformity. Americans, it was feared, had become too worried about fitting in, too afraid to be independent. Do not fold, spindle or mutilate, the instruction on computer punch cards, became a slogan against docile regimentation. Now, to judge by new evidence, the cycle has swung back again to individualism, indeed swung past self all the way to selfish. The evidence comes from a New York Times survey conducted for this special issue. The selfishness is not shameless; in fact, the public seems somewhat conflicted. People bemoan the self-centeredness they see around them. They regret that family ties are weakening. They complain that they cant trust most people.

They regret that family ties are weakening. They complain that they cant trust most people. But at the same time, they express starkly individualistic views. When presented with a list of basic values, they strongly identify with personal responsibility, self-sufficiency and self-expression. And not many see the contradiction -- that if everyone puts highest priority on ones own interests, then family and community ties may weaken further. The watchword has evolved from Rugged Individual to Im O.K., Youre Selfish. Individualism may feel like a natural condition, but many of its aspects did not develop until the last thousand years. Surnames, for example, did not emerge until the mid-1300s. Before then men typically were identified only by the names of their fathers -- John, son of Henry; Martin, Peters son -- and women took the names of their fathers or husbands. In eastern Europe, Jews typically did not have last names until the early 1800s, and in America, far into the 19th century, slaves were not permitted to have surnames unless given one by their owners.

Until then, to get from room A to room E, one had to walk through all the rooms in between. The newest aspect of individualism is that more people can aspire to it. A rising standard of living has freed most Americans from having to spend every waking hour satisfying basic needs. Middle-class affluence has also reduced the need to rely on parents or children and has enabled many more people to go it alone. A hundred years ago, few people lived by themselves; today 1 out of 4 households contains only one person. Meanwhile, the character of individualism has changed.

That is about emotional gratification, self-help, getting in touch with feelings, expressing personal needs. Utilitarian individualism is going West, on Horace Greeleys advice, to find your fortune. Expressive individualism is going to the forest, on Robert Blys advice, to find your inner essence. Expressive individualism has flourished as prosperity has given more Americans the time and money to cultivate their own emotional gardens. It was not always so: if my grandparents had been asked about the importance of communicating their feelings, they might not have understood the question. They were too busy running a grocery store, raising 10 children and trying to survive the Great Depression.

In testimony that traced his 25 years in the business, Gordon E. Eubanks Jr. portrayed the software business as an entrepreneurial hotbed, fast changing and fluid, where todays dominant company can quickly become tomorrows also-ran. And Microsoft is under threat today, Mr. Eubanks said, because the center of gravity in computing is shifting rapidly beyond what he called the PC centric world ruled by Microsoft and its Windows operating system. The key, Mr. Eubanks told the court, is that software programmers are writing more and more programs to run on Internet technology, notably on browsing software, instead of on Windows. The momentum of development for writing programs has gone to the browser, testified Mr. Eubanks, president of Oblix, a Silicon Valley start-up. The browser comment -- though meant to suggest that Microsoft is no entrenched monopolist -- supports the Governments case, according to David Boies, the Justice Departments lead trial lawyer.

But traditional cable networks are built to transmit information in only one direction: from the company toward the user, and not the reverse. That poses a problem for telephones, which inherently provide a two-way service. Traditional telephone networks are in some way the obverse of cable systems: they easily transmit communications in two directions, but they do not have to carry much information at the same time. Broken down into the ones and zeros of digital communications, a phone call is a subcompact beside the tractor-trailer of a single television channel.

Many of the big communications carriers that spend billions each year to upgrade their systems want to stop operating separate voice and data networks.

But the Government presented E-mail written at the time in which the witness himself and other Microsoft executives portrayed Netscape as a potentially dangerous rival. The point is crucial because that meeting between Microsoft and Netscape is a key episode in the Governments antitrust case. With document after document supplementing his acerbic cross-examination, David Boies, the Justice Departments lead trial lawyer in the case against the Microsoft Corporation, proceeded today with perhaps the most sweeping attack on the credibility of a witness since the trial began last October. Again and again, he tried to point to contradictions between what Daniel Rosen, the witness, was saying today and what he and other Microsoft executives had written and said in the past.

Microsoft replies that Mr. Rosen was simply trying to be precise about highly detailed discussions of software technology and strategy. And Mr. Rosen testified that his belief that Netscape did not intend to compete with Microsoft was based on what Netscape executives told him then. Mr. Rosen led a team from Microsoft that met with Netscape executives on June 21, 1995, when the Government contends that Microsoft threatened Netscape and made an illegal offer to divide the Internet browser market between them.

Driven largely by optimism about the Internet, investment in American technology start-ups will probably reach approximately $50 billion for this year -- about 10 times more than in 1994. This eagerness to invest in the latest start-up is, of course, another aspect of the same rush of capital that we are seeing when high-technology companies go public. On Thursday, the stock of VA Linux Systems had the biggest first-day gain for any initial public offering in history.

Until very recently, the venture capital industry was a small club, verging on a cartel, and the technology sector was for geeks in California, period. Money was tight, particularly during the technology sector recession in the early 1990s. In 1994, I spent five brutal months raising $4 million for my first company, an early Internet software start-up. At the time, there were maybe a thousand Web sites in the world. But since the onset of the commercial Internet revolution in 1995, money has flooded into the Internet, with the size of the venture capital industry roughly doubling every year.

It is now much easier for entrepeneurs to raise money. I recently founded my second Internet start-up. This time, I raised over $3 million in the first month. The Internet has also made business life a lot fairer. You dont have to stay in a big, bureaucratic company anymore; you can join a start-up.

But the fact that virtually any idea -- no matter how dubious -- can obtain money, and that so much money is available, is also causing problems. Competition among Internet companies is increasingly a financial arms race. They must raise huge war chests, give away their products, advertise on television, and pay insanely high salaries -- simply because their competitors do. The glut of money also has companies -- and the industry as a whole -- growing insanely fast, leading to labor shortages everywhere -- of not only engineers and managers, but graphic designers, accountants, headhunters, telephone system installers. Fortune seekers, many of them unqualified, flood to the Internet -- both to start companies and to work in them. This leads to sloppy work and some fairly sleazy behavior."}

On Wall Street, where nothing succeeds like excess, investment bankers take a Darwinian view of these frenzies, pushing as many companies as possible through the financing process while the publics appetite is whetted but before it is sated. This year, it is a feast. The eager Internet start-ups are so numerous that investment banks tell of having to turn away potential clients while some companies have resorted to trying creative methods to whisk their documents through regulatory approvals.

I think what will amaze people in 3000 A.D. about peace symbols is not their idealism but the fact that they were ever considered idealistic. The end of war between nations is a nearly certain achievement of the next millennium, if not the next century. The last time this sort of optimism was fashionable was during the giddy aftermath of the cold war, a decade ago.

But in truth these examples illustrate the opposite. To see what I mean, you have to first see that the link between the global village and world peace is not the one that John and Yoko might have envisioned: that global communication automatically brings mutual understanding, hence peace. If things were that simple, we wouldnt have many wars to begin with. Fighting is typically preceded by talking, after all. No, another ingredient besides communication is necessary. The people doing the communicating have to have a strong interest in peace and understanding to begin with. The key thing about the information technology now enveloping the world is the way it strengthens that interest.

Fortunately for world peace, rising interdependence is a basic property of history. Civilizations rise and fall, dark ages come and go, but in the long run, technological evolution moves in only one direction. From cuneiform to computer, from camel to Concorde, the division of economic labor gets more elaborate and more far-flung; people, and peoples, need one another more. Today, in the highly globalized capitalist states on the edge of this trend, interdependence is felt more broadly than ever, by armies of businesspeople who communicate with their counterparts in other cultures.

After all, these places are underglobalized. Sure, they have Nikes and Coca-Cola, but they havent been intricately, organically penetrated by modern capitalism. Even the more economically advanced of these areas, in the former Yugoslavia, missed much of the Industrial Revolution and then spent much of this century under a mild but still retarding form of Communism. And, anyway, note how much of the recent conflict is traceable to the end of the cold war, which for half a century kept artificial state borders intact around the world. Some transitional reordering is not surprising, and theres probably more to come. But the cold war can end only once.

I hear a lot of people talking about business models, but I dont hear much about customer value, Mr. Bezos said. If value was indeed going to be the key, a lot of business models were going to have to change -- most notably the telecommunications industrys, on which the Internet was being built. But instead of clanging like a gong in the heads of telecommunications executives, the cautionary logic of those words apparently continues to fall on deaf ears.
