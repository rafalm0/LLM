That wave hit corporate America as a whole in 1999, when companies large and small recognized that the impact of the Internet would not be confined merely to Silicon Valley or to the proliferating dot-com start-ups. Every business now knows that it faces the opportunity and threat of being transformed by the Internet, and this was the year that happened, said Daniel Yergin, a business consultant and author. The Internet has also become a powerful symbol of societys expectations about the future -- a future of fast-moving, disruptive technology that is shifting the terrain not only in business, but also in politics and culture. The truth, of course, is that it is probably too early to judge whether an Internet revolution is truly under way. Historians say the Internet should be viewed mainly as the latest advance in communications, a successor to the telegraph and the telephone, more a technological step than a leap forward.

Still, whether labeled a revolution or an evolution, the Internets impact on the economy seems destined to become greater and greater. When people speak of the Internet economy, they do not really mean that Internet businesses themselves suddenly loom so large in the nations $9 trillion economy. They are talking of a technology and a pattern of business behavior that feels like the future. The Internet is seen as a technology of borderless free markets. It is a global network with open technology standards, not owned or controlled by a single company or nation. And it is magic on Wall Street these days, driving the shares of many Internet companies to astronomical heights. Because it is such a low-cost communications technology, the Internet holds the promise of drastically reducing transactions costs. This opens the door to what Michael Porter of Harvards business school has called atomistic competition, as market forces and entrepreneurial ways are driven further down toward the individual level.

Organizational bureaucracies of every kind -- corporate, government and union -- suddenly look vulnerable to the Internets decentralizing powers. Even the power of nation states, already eroding, seems at risk. Mr. Yergin, the co-author with Joseph Stanislaw of The Commanding Heights, a history of the rise of the global marketplace, observed: Nothing so symbolizes globalization as the Internet, a technology with the power to leap across the geographic borders of nation-states and across time zones. Prediction tends to be a humbling, hit-or-miss endeavor even for the gifted or lucky. In the late 1960s, for example, Sir Arthur C. Clarke, the science fiction writer, predicted that by 2000 a vast electronic global library would be developed -- and the Internet and the World Wide Web could arguably qualify as one.

Then again, Sir Arthur also predicted that the planets would be colonized by next year. But technologists, economists and futurists say that some questions are worth asking when thinking about how the Internet economy might evolve over the next few years. What was the mixture of technology and policy decisions that created todays Internet? What key technology and policy issues are likely to affect the Internet over the next few years? And, finally, since the future is usually the past with a twist, what can be learned from earlier technology-driven transitions? The Internet has been embraced by libertarian free-marketers as the embodiment of their values, but, to be sure, it began with government financing. Yet liberals who point to the Internet to support a pro-government stance -- at least in any conventional sense -- are ignoring certain facts. The early money for the Internet -- as well as for pioneering research in computer graphics and speech recognition software -- came from an elite, the Pentagons Advanced Research Projects Agency.

From the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s, the agencys leaders displayed an uncanny knack for backing long-term winners in technology. For two decades, the Internet was developed gradually in the distinctive milieu of the nations research centers by scientists who believed in the free sharing of information and in open technology standards. The next major policy pronouncement about the Internet did not come until 1997, when the Clinton administration released its Framework for Global Electronic Commerce. Written by Ira C. Magaziner, a senior White House adviser, the report called for a market-driven Internet. Business models must evolve rapidly to keep pace with the breakneck speed of change in the technology, the report said.

But as the Internet increasingly becomes a main thoroughfare of commerce, a host of new policy issues loom -- how to deal with taxation, privacy, security and international trade in a global networked economy. The Internet has given us the greatest rate of return on a public infrastructure investment ever, said Robert Litan, director of economic studies at the Brookings Institution. And it has flourished because we have not yet taxed or regulated it to death -- though those are live issues. Technologically, the Internet is almost an economy unto itself -- a network, yes, but also a complex and interacting set of technologies.

The sheer firepower of computers, experts say, is certain to race ahead to startling effect over the next few years. Data storage technology, for example, is advancing at a particularly rapid rate. By 2003, personal computers may well come with terabyte hard drives, which are roughly 100 times the capacity on new PCs today, featuring about 10 gigabytes on average. A terabyte drive would be able to hold every conversation that even the chattiest person has had in a lifetime. Think of a supercomputer on every desktop, in terms of giving individuals the ability to mine personal or business information. In every field of academic and scientific research, computing will increasingly be used for simulation and analysis.

The real technical challenge to the Internet economy will not come from any shortcoming in raw computing power, but from the difficulty of building up the global network to meet demand. The next-generation vision of the Internet is of a high-speed global network to which billions of devices are connected, from TV set-top boxes and hand-held computers to refrigerators and washing machines that would be able to do everything from optimizing fuel use to requesting a repair call automatically online.

The huge data center, run by I.B.M., is one of the engine rooms of the Internet, powering the World Wide Web sites and electronic commerce operations of some 400 companies and organizations including Bank of America, Macys, Goodyear and the National Hockey League. Such computer centers, known as server farms, are the unglamorous side of the Internet revolution -- a world apart from the young, urban culture of Web design artists with their tattoos and earrings. Here, a no-nonsense style prevails, and the hallways tend to be populated by big, beefy men with beepers.

The personal computer has defined the industrys recent history and how computers were used.

Millions of islands of information were suddenly stored on desktop machines -knowledge residing in the spreadsheet, word processing and data base programs of individuals.

Novell hopes the technology, called Digital Me, will gain acceptance as a standard means of controlling identity on the World Wide Web, permitting network users to reveal or retain as much personal information as they wish. At Novells annual users group meeting today in Provo, Utah, the company plans to demonstrate a simple personal computer version of the Digital Me software, which acts as a digital safe-deposit box for personal information -- not only name, address, credit card numbers and such, but also possibly the telltale electronic codes that can identify a persons PC and be used to trace his or her Web travels.

Like so many entrepreneurs in the 1990s, Ms. Zraly -- a consultant, lecturer and author -- headed for the World Wide Web. Her Web site, Champagnelady.com, is a decidedly modest foray into Internet commerce. It amounts to an advertisement for herself and an on-line shop for merchandise, including a book she has written and all manner of champagne paraphernalia, glasses, ice buckets, even earrings.

For suppliers, E-Chemicals offers a low-cost way to sell to small customers, right down to sales of a couple of 55-gallon drums. For smaller buyers, E-Chemicals promises to substantially level the playing field by offering the kind of lower prices usually available only to distributors big customers. E-Chemicals can do that because of its lower expenses, operating as a kind of virtual corporation that uses subcontractors for much of its basic work. It has just 20 employees.

The research, according to Mr. Litan, will look forward, trying to assess the Internets effects as they are diffused across the economy. It wont be traditional economics and it wont be easy, Mr. Litan said.

After reviewing the privacy practices of World Wide Web sites, the commission told Congress that the industry had fallen far short of what is needed to protect consumers. Only a tiny fraction of Web sites, the F.T.C. noted, told people what the sites did with the personal information they collected -- names, E-mail addresses, credit card numbers. Even fewer sites offered consumers any choice about how their personal data were used, allowed them to access the data or gave assurances of its security. Industry self-regulation, the F.T.C. concluded, was not working. Its scathing report increased the chances that Congress would enact sweeping Internet privacy legislation. And the findings hardened resolve in Europe to reject the American self-regulatory approach to privacy on line, a dispute that threatened to escalate into the first Internet trade war. Christine Varney, the commissions Internet expert until she left in August 1997, had long warned the industry that if it did not move to shoulder responsibility on privacy, the Government would surely step in.

On April 17, 1998, some 60 lawyers, lobbyists and executives gathered in an 11th floor conference room at I.B.M.s Washington office, representing several companies that included America Online, I.B.M., Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft, plus a few trade groups like the Direct Marketing Association.

Her success, privacy advocates say, has been as a Washington insider guiding a shrewd campaign of persuasion and not, as the industry alliance asserts, in prodding on-line companies to adopt meaningful privacy policies. But even her critics admire her work.

And the group has even made headway on impressing Europes trade negotiators. The jury is still out as to whether self-regulation will work, but there is no doubt that the industry has made a lot of progress on the Internet privacy issue in the last year or so, said Robert Pitofsky, chairman of the F.T.C.

I think we can have a market-driven approach to privacy on the Internet, she said. And, at least, this experiment with self-regulation is worth doing. Lets see if the marketplace can do it.

That 66 percent is pretty astonishing from where we were a year ago, Ms. Varney observed. From my perspective, that means that self-regulation is working. But privacy advocates point to other numbers as evidence that self-regulation is failing. They note, for example, that the 1999 Georgetown survey also found that only 10 percent of Web sites included the four touchstones of what the F.T.C. calls fair information practices: notifying users of the sites data collection practices; giving users a choice of opting out; giving them access to personal data, and assuring them that their personal data were secure. The same four principles also serve as the basis for the Online Privacy Alliances voluntary guidelines, but critics say the principles are too vaguely worded, giving companies too much leeway, to protect consumers."}

And those policies are just window-dressing unless they are backed up by a credible system of enforcement, said Deborah Hurley, director of Harvard Universitys Information Infrastructure Project. The industry has financed independent privacy monitoring organizations, like eTrust and BBB Online. Even so, enforcement remains an issue for privacy groups and in negotiations between the United States and Europe. To date, much of the development of privacy practices on line has been by the marketplace, responding to complaints, often by the thousands. In 1997, for example, when word spread that America Online planned to pass along customers telephone numbers to telemarketers and other direct-sales merchants, the big Internet service provider heard a consumer outcry -- and quickly dropped the plan. Likewise Amazon.com, the big on-line bookstore, ran into a backlash last month when it posted purchase circles, which showed the book buying habits of users from selected companies and universities.

Likewise Amazon.com, the big on-line bookstore, ran into a backlash last month when it posted purchase circles, which showed the book buying habits of users from selected companies and universities. Some users found this a breach of privacy without consent and asked to be removed. After asking employees for their reaction, Louis V. Gerstner Jr., chairman of the International Business Machines Corporation, received 5,000 E-mail responses within hours. More than 90 percent objected to having their book-buying habits as a group disclosed on line. I.B.M. was removed from the book-purchase circles. Later, Mr. Gerstner wrote to Jeff Bezos, chief executive of Amazon.com, saying, Im certainly not going to tell you how to run your business, but I do urge you to view this as an enormously important issue. Some on-line privacy issues have surfaced case by case.

America Onlines thousands of customer service representatives are now given special scenario training to insure that they do not give out private information about users without those users consent or a court order. This trial-and-error, market-driven approach to privacy, Internet executives note, has often resulted in stricter practices than those, for example, of the credit card and catalog industries. Besides, they add, a rapid response system for customers is built into the Internet, where E-mail complaining and chat room organizing can punish companies more quickly and more severely than Government regulations can.

Most on-line consumers, apparently, are willing to fend for themselves on the increasingly commercial Internet. A survey by Privacy and American Business, a research firm, found that 86 percent of 460 adult Internet users questioned earlier this year said they wanted to be able to essentially trade their own personal information with Web sites -- as long as they were properly informed about how their data were used and were offered benefits for doing so.

Yet many people argue that some basic legislation to protect individual privacy on the Internet is inevitable -- and that it could both benefit consumers and stimulate the growth of E-commerce by fostering greater public trust in doing business on line.

Tim Berners-Lee, the British physicist who created the basic software for the Web, is the director of the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His consortium is working on privacy-enhancing technology, software that holds a persons privacy preferences and can communicate and bargain on an individuals behalf over the Internet.

The spread of Internet technology will result in a data collection network of previously unimagined reach as telephones, televisions, cars and appliances -- not just personal computers -- are connected to the global digital network before long. And the rapidly developing fields of data-mining and profiling software will enable corporations to increasingly slice and search through this ocean of data to identify personal patterns of buying and behavior -- and make inferences, accurate or not, about a persons likely behavior. The unnerving prospect, according to Paul Saffo, a director for the Institute for the Future, is that we will all be players in what could be a fairly inaccurate virtual Truman Show. At stake, technologists say, is far more than who gets which Internet marketing pitches. Profiling, they say, could be employed to determine who gets -- and who is excluded from -- all kinds of opportunities like jobs, housing and education. The F.T.C. is also studying the use and potential abuse of increasingly powerful Internet software. The commission has scheduled a public workshop on on-line profiling in November."}

But it could also be enormously empowering by allowing individuals to make their own choices and by saving us all time and money. Particularly in the future, we will face more difficult decisions and trade-offs. But I think that argues for leaving those decisions to the marketplace for privacy as much as we can.

And why not? Amazon, a corporate poster child of the New Economy and pioneer of on-line retailing, would be collecting money from any business, large or small, that wanted to set up shop under its cyber-tent. Besides, Amazon really needs the cash. Its losses are mounting, as they are for most Internet merchants. But, Amazon explains, the red ink merely underlines the scale of its ambitious investment for future growth. And what is Amazon spending so lavishly on these days? Building a high-tech bunker of supercomputers or hiring battalions of software wizards? No, Amazon is spending much of its money on a half-dozen huge warehouses across the country.

Indeed, as electronic commerce moves into the mainstream -- an estimated 17 million American households will purchase on line this year -- it has prompted a new appreciation for the business skills of the old bricks-and-mortar world. Customers, it seems, still have decidedly off-line standards of service. They demand timely delivery of goods and the ability to easily return merchandise that proves disappointing, for example. The on-line retailers who come up short on those fronts, industry analysts predict, will be casualties in the coming consolidation among on-line retailers -- a Darwinian winnowing expected to begin during this years Christmas shopping season as winners are sorted from losers. A lot of the dot-com retailers are going to fold after their venture capital money runs out, observed David Pecaut, a senior vice president of the Boston Consulting Group.

Within five years, Mr. Pecaut expects that share to rise to 85 percent as companies like Wal-Mart, Nordstrom and Sears improve their performance on the World Wide Web. THE reason, he says, is that their assets from the legacy world -- well-known brands, distribution networks, stores and purchasing power -- will prove to be advantages, and increasingly so in electronic commerce. The leading on-line brands like Amazon and Ebay, for example, came onto the marketplace a few years ago as innovative newcomers, when cyberspace was far less crowded and Internet brand-building was far less costly. The chance of an Internet start-up gaining that kind of brand recognition today, Mr. Pecaut says, is slim.

The new catch phrases of modern retailing have embraced that notion: multi-channel retailers, integrated shopping and 360-degree marketing. All are meant to convey the concept of servicing -- or assaulting -- the consumer on many fronts, on line and off. Some Internet companies are even using their high-priced shares as currency to buy bricks-and-mortar counterparts. For example, the on-line auctioneer Ebay purchased Butterfield & Butterfield, a San Francisco-based auction house founded in 1865, for $260 million in stock earlier this year. The statistics for on-line retail sales, and projections of future revenue, show meteoric growth. Yet a closer look at the numbers suggests how much traditional retailing retains its hold, despite the rapid, up-from-zero growth of E-commerce.

The essence of the new Internet economy is its ferocious speed, the faith that this is a big deal and the uncertainty that it will pay off, said Thomas Eisenmann, an E-commerce expert at the Harvard Business School. The economic payoff from Internet technology will almost surely come first in an area that gets the least attention: its use as a low-cost communications technology to automate all kinds of business transactions.

Forrester Research projects that the business-to-business market could reach $1.5 trillion by 2003. But even the Internet-assisted overhaul of dealings among businesses in the next few years represents an evolutionary instead of a revolutionary step.

Microsoft in effect conceded that the feature, a unique identifying number used by Windows and other Microsoft products, had the potential to be more invasive than a traceable serial number in the Intel Corporations new Pentium III computer chip that has privacy advocates up in arms. The difference is that the Windows number is tied to an individuals name, to identifying numbers on the hardware in his computer and even to documents that he creates. The combination of the Windows number with all these data, the privacy advocates said, could result in the ability to track a single user and the documents he created across vast computer networks.

Microsoft software engineers say the roots of the companys numbering system go back to a system developed by computer researchers at the Open Software Foundation in Cambridge in the early 1990s. In an effort to develop technology that would enable computers to communicate across networks, a numbering system called a Universally Unique Identifier, or UUID, was established as part of a software standard known as the Distributed Computing Environment, or DCE. Microsoft relied on this standard when it developed a remote computing capability for Windows known as Object Linking and Embedding, or OLE.

This technology is something we havent examined closely, yet it allows companies to collect great amounts of information without the slightest knowledge by consumers that it is being collected, said Robert Pitofsky, the F.T.C. chairman.It certainly strikes me as a troubling notion.

Many key issues about online profiling technology, privacy experts say, lie in the future as the software becomes increasingly powerful. The profiling companies note that their technology identifies a users machine through an identifying software tag on its browser. But, they add, the profiling software does not track individual users by name.

It has continued despite cyclical advertising recessions and intermittent shocks, like Wal-Marts suffocation of small businesses, whose advertising died with them. Classifieds, in particular, brought in a higher and higher percentage of newspaper advertising dollars. The figures of the Newspaper Association of America show classifieds represented 18 percent of advertisers newspaper spending in 1950; 26 percent in 1975; and 41.5 percent last year. Now, the question is how much revenue newspapers are going to lose to the hundreds of Internet competitors, and how quickly. While the weighty pile of printed classifieds is not fading away any time soon, Michael J. Beebe, a media analyst for Goldman, Sachs, said flatly, There is going to be an erosion in revenue and profitability in the old-fashioned newspaper classifieds. Thats not"}

Theyre all searching for it. For the past four years, through investments in on-line ventures like AdOne L.L.C., Careerpath.com, Classified Ventures and Careers.wsj.com, newspaper companies have scrambled to compete in the fast-growing world of on-line classifieds. Their competitors come from all over -- an employment-advertising agency like Omnicoms Bernard Hodes Agency, which also happened to be the single largest purchaser of newspaper advertising ($572 million in 1997, according to Editor & Publisher) and operates Careermosaic.com.

The list gets longer daily. Less than two weeks ago, the CBS Corporation took a 38 percent share of Jobs.com, a Texas company, in return for a pledge of $62 million in promotion and other considerations. The geometric expansion of on-line competitors coincided with a disturbing dip in newspapers help-wanted advertising during portions of the past 18 months in at least five markets -- San Jose, Dallas, Boston, New York and Los Angeles. Newspaper executives and industry analysts are cautious about attributing all the drop to the on-line predators.

While paper is portable, it cannot match the Internet for fine-grained search capabilities. Robert W. Decherd, the chairman and chief executive of the Belo Corporation, is hardly panicking. At Belos flagship, The Dallas Morning News, he said, Its not as if classifieds have fallen off a cliff. But, he added, There is one major category that is temporarily disabled -- employment ads. And the drop in help-wanted ads, in some markets, more than offset gains in auto and real-estate ads.

At the vast Comdex personal computer trade show in Las Vegas in November, the buzz seemed to be about everything but the personal computer. There was hype about Web pads -- handy, wireless slates for surfing the Web, in effect portable computers with screen but without keyboard. And there was more hype about Internet appliances, which are devices other than computers that provide Web access. Even William H. Gates, the Microsoft chairman who is high priest of the PC, took time out from his presentation to showcase what he called a Web companion, a computer that eschews the Windows operating system in gaining access to the Web. It looks much like the network appliance that Mr. Gates once reviled when it was first proposed by his companys rivals, Sun Microsystems and the Oracle Corporation.

By comparison, the PCs on display, whose makers seemed focused on repackaging their machines in different-colored boxes, appeared drab and uninspired. It has begun to seem that, like the mainframe computer, the venerable PC may be on the verge of being supplanted -- by more powerful technologies promising quick and easy access to the Internet through devices that are highly portable, less costly and readily adopted by non-PC users. Indeed, hot Silicon Valley companies like Phone.com, the telephone Web browser company based in Redwood City, Calif., are reporting gleefully that beginning next year, almost half the cellular phones sold will come equipped with the ability to surf the Web. Moreover, they predict that at the current growth rate, the number of Web browsers in phones will exceed the number in PCs in 2001.

If using the Internet rather than spreadsheets and word processors is driving the growth of the personal computer industry, then mobile access to the Internet is likely to dominate in short order. Who could possibly argue that surfing the Web while trapped sitting in a chair at a desk is natural or inevitable? The one flaw in this argument is that PC sales are not shrinking. PC industry growth has been in double-digit figures for six years, and it is expected to strengthen this year to 20.6 percent, near the 21.3 percent increase posted for 1994-95, according to Dataquest, the market research firm based in San Jose, Calif.

Jobs, a rival who became a nominal ally after Microsoft invested in Apple Computer in 1997.

The problem with defending the PC in this debate is that the rise ofthe Internet has changed the role of the PC. Rather than an end in itself, the PC is now merely one of a variety of Internet entry points. The advent of the Internet has shifted the focus of the industry from personal computing to the Internet and e-business, said Irving Wladawsky-Berger, general manager of International Business Machines Corporations Internet division.

Sony is readying its PlayStation 2, while Nintendo is developing a new system, code-named Dolphin. Using the new chips, both of these machines will probably be part video-game player, part Internet appliance. Which would you rather have in your living room: a Windows 98 PC or a Sony PlayStation 2? the Microprocessor Report editorial asks. For most people, the Play Station 2 is a better choice.

A companys Internet IQ, argues Don Listwin, Ciscos executive V.P., is the product of two measures: the degree to which its own internal operations -- and how it delivers products and services -- are now built around using the Internet, and the degree to which its external behavior exploits the global spread of the Internet. To find your companys IQ, start by assigning one point for each of the following internal criteria it meets: (1) Does your management understand the opportunities, and destructive potential, of the Internet for its business?

The wave of images of Serbian tanks departing and ethnic Albanians returning is only the latest to show the paroxysm of Kosovo. From the terror of airborne high- technology bombing to the terror of the Serb military campaign, the conflict has produced war coverage that, according to editors, correspondents and media critics, was in some basic ways different from any battlefield coverage that had come before. There was both more censorship -- and more information. Military censors racheted up controls during the bombing but satellite communications allowed reporters from Brussels to Kukes, Albania, to triangulate information more easily than in earlier conflicts.

There, both Wall Street investment banks have flourished, riding the wave of dot-com companies that have enriched themselves by offering shares to a rapacious public or selling out to each other. But in recent years, another big Wall Street name has been conspicuously scarce in the Silicon Valley gold rush: Merrill Lynch. The firms sideline status has been puzzling, given that as much as one-quarter of the revenue generated by investment banking departments these days comes from advising technology companies on mergers and public stock offerings. So why has Merrill largely missed out on technology bankers big bull market? To hear Merrill Lynch explain it, the firm has not missed out at all; it simply got a late start. Tom Davis, executive vice president of Merrills corporate and institutional client group, said the company was only three years into a multiyear effort to expand its technology presence worldwide.

Of course, technology executives have heard that before. When Merrill set up an office in Palo Alto, Calif., in 1996, it was the third attempt to crack Silicon Valleys clubby community, after abortive efforts in the 1980s and early 1990s. Mr. Davis said the company had been too busy expanding other departments to focus much on technology in those days. Given its relatively late start, Merrill has made a respectable showing this year. According to Thomson Financial/Securities Data, Merrill ranked fourth in taking new technology companies public in 1999, as measured by the amount of money raised. That is a far cry from 1997, when it did not even rank among the top 20.

She is Jonatha Brooke. CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES SUNDAY MAY 16, 1999 THERE are two great pop music dreams. And they usually follow each other, like marriage and divorce. The first great dream is to get together with friends in a basement or garage, write songs, make music, feel the magic and perform at local clubs until a big record label rushes in waving a contract. And then the label takes care of the rest: hit singles, arena shows, limos, parties, a new house for mom. But the dream, even for those few who actually get to live it, has usually been a nightmare. Thats when the next great dream kicks in. This is the dream of independence, of breaking away from the record label and going it alone. Its about rethinking the first dream, remembering that the most exciting part of being in a band was when you did it yourself. There was the joy of selling the first three copies of a CD"}

Its about rethinking the first dream, remembering that the most exciting part of being in a band was when you did it yourself. There was the joy of selling the first three copies of a CD or cassette you made on your own. Back then, you actually made a few bucks off those sales. Now, under a record label, promotional costs are so high that you may see no actual money, even if youre lucky enough to sell a million albums. And then there are the long tours spanning four continents, the executives that keep sending you back into the studio asking for hits despite the fact that you considered your album finished months ago, and the three-year gap between the release of each record. Signing to a big label suddenly doesnt seem like a step up anymore; it seems like a sacrifice.

You take those 48 pages of a typical contract and hold it in front of anyone familiar with other types of business contracts, and they think its insane. A slew of recent events -- from the panic at major labels over the distribution of music on the Internet to the bloodletting following large music company mergers -- has made it clear to musicians that the structure of major record companies is not conducive to either their financial or, more important, their artistic goals. Talking to everyone from up-and-coming bands to those who have been signed for more than a decade, from artists with low sales to superstars, from lawyers to former executives, there is a growing dissatisfaction with a system that has been building its fortress for more than 100 years -- since a company called Columbia sprung up"}

This dissatisfaction stems less from the fact that the companies are owned by multinational conglomerates than from the belief that the labels are simply too big, numbers-driven and inefficient. Artists who could be much farther along in their creative work get bogged down in the bureaucracy. Waiting for the new record from Perry Farrell of Janes Addiction? Keep waiting. Its already been rejected by his record label, Warner Brothers, several times. And what ever happened to Joan Osborne? Her label hasnt liked her new material either. The Verve Pipe?

Thanks in part to the rise of the Internet and music-business consolidation, a window has opened, one in which making this sacrifice of artistic freedom for commercial success may no longer be necessary. In the next few years, either a lot of best-selling musicians are going to climb through that window or the window is going to slam shut, tighter than it ever was before. Take a look at the music industry today. Manufactured teeny-bopper bands are dominating the pop world, corporate mergers are squeezing hundreds of musicians out of the business without even giving them the rights to their recordings, and executives of major record labels are meeting behind closed doors to develop a way to police and control the distribution of music on the Internet.

These events are pointing the way to an exit from the status quo by fostering dissent and inadvertently giving musicians the freedom to act on it. In recent years, several people have stepped up to try to make the business work better for musicians and their fans, among them the musician, computer whiz and virtual-reality pioneer Jaron Lanier and the progressive rock guitarist Robert Fripp of King Crimson. They are developing new companies in hopes of chipping away at a business that loses money on far more records than it profits from.

The golden age of the Internet -- as a freewheeling, chaotic world where all information is available free of charge and everybody is equal -- is fast coming to an end. Theres too much money at stake for it not to be transformed into a new revenue stream for corporations. Look at the record labels. It may seem as if they are running scared because recent technological advances have made it very easy for Internet users to copy and distribute their favorite CDs on line without authorization, but the truth is that the labels have already found a way to turn this new technology to their financial advantage. Most major labels have added whats called a new technology deduction clause to the contracts they offer bands. What it does is subtract 15 to 25 percent of the royalty rate of 12 to 13 percent that a new band receives for each record sold.

Even the lawyers with the most power cant get rid of those clauses, said Ken Freundlich, a top music-industry lawyer. Its the same mind-set the labels have had since the CD: bring on the new technology, cut the royalty rate. The head of a record company, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said he wasnt worried about artists releasing their CDs independently on the Internet. How are they going to compete with someone putting $10 million into another Web site? he asked. Do you know how big the Internets going to be? Youre going to need infrastructure.

The vision is of a level playing field where all bands regardless of their record label or financing have equal access to the ears of the consumer. Instead, the chances of a dystopian world are increasing, one in which record companies have even greater control over music distribution, and new bands are signed not because of how they sound but because of how many visitors come to their Internet site each month. At present, record companies have a great deal of control. A record deal is basically a service contract that puts the musician in the employ of the record company. In all but the rarest cases, by signing a deal musicians forfeit their ownership of any music they make under that contract. And, from the outset, the musician is put in a position of accepting debt.

Because the debt is paid out of the small royalty that musicians make, most acts never see a penny from their record sales. The record company executive said: A lot of lawyers and artists dont understand how the record business works. Artists dont have $50 million in overhead. We dont make money on their T-shirts and concerts that we market and promote. For the music fan, far more disturbing than the financial toll record labels exact from artists is the creative one. Except in the case of an extremely slow, laborious songwriter like Leonard Cohen, artistic creativity moves at a much faster rate than the current system allows.

If the majors cannot adapt to change, they become solely banking systems. If they could sell Brillo pads with a slice of cheese on them, theyd do that, because the music is irrelevant to them.

But her experiences trying to release records have been soul-crushing, and as a result she has only put out two albums in eight years. Her first label, Giant, got cold feet and canceled her contract before releasing her first album. Her second label, Imago, folded before her second record came out, and, just after Ms. Mann completed her third album for her third label, Geffen, the company was consolidated into Interscope as a result of the merger of both labels parent company, Universal Music, with Polygram.

Labels have built their business on hits. If they had developed a model that could profit from a record that sold 200,000 copies, the way many independent labels do, they could have made money by putting out the five or so records that Ms. Mann -- or the scores of other performers in similar situations -- might have released. This mishandling doesnt just happen with serious artists. Another merger casualty was the teeny-bopper band Boyzone, which suffered a setback in its chance for success in America when, to meet a quarterly quota, its label, Mercury, quietly released 30,000 copies of its album before the merger instead of waiting to set up the record properly.

History has proved over and over that one decades failures (whether its the Velvet Undergrounds proto-punk or Joni Mitchells redirection into jazz) can become the next decades classics. But the history of the music business is one of inefficiencies, dating back to the late 19th century, when less than half the sheet music released paid back the high cost of marketing the music, despite the tactic of paying well-known performers to include the song in their repertories.

Here is one more story, a common tale with a new twist: Josh Clayton-Felt, formerly of the rock group School of Fish, spent three years working on his second solo album for A&M Records. Every time he thought he was finished, label executives sent him back into the studio with the four words that have become anathema to working musicians, It needs a hit. Mr. Clayton-Felt turned in a total of 22 songs, then waited for executives to set a release date for the record. But after eight months, A&M was taken over by Interscope.

So he decided he would rent a studio and record new versions of the songs. But Universal still said no: a clause in his contract prevented his rerecording the songs for five years. BOB BERNSTEIN, a spokesman for Universal, said that Mr. Clayton-Felt had been told that his album could either be released independently for a limited term or shopped to a major label. If he garnered interest from a major, Universal would be willing to negotiate a sale of that record, he said. For four months, Mr. Clayton-Felt wrestled with the label and with himself.

Bertelsmann is already expected to offer stock later this week in its on-line bookselling joint venture with Barnes & Noble Inc., Barnesandnoble.com.

Within the next few months, Mr. Middelhoff said last week, the company plans to switch to a package of fixed monthly rates for subscribers of America Online Inc.s Europe operation, in which Bertelsmann owns a 50 percent stake.

But it is a private company, and so Bertelsmann has not had publicly traded stock to use as a currency for making deals in this age of stock deals. Nor has Bertelsmann had the kind of high profile and brand recognition that lend instant cachet to a public stock offering. In this Internet world, we compete with companies that are public, said Mr. Middelhoff, who is intent on competing with nimble rivals like Amazon.com.

Mr. Middelhoff is also tending to the political aspects that will come with owning a publicly traded company. He is considering offering some sort of stock options to all Bertelsmann managers to avoid creating two classes of executives within the corporation. He is also expanding the seminars offered through Bertelsmann University, a business training program done in conjunction with Harvard University that seeks to increase cooperation among the companys managers. The only way to achieve the changes we want is through the brains of our executives, Mr. Middelhoff said. And they really have to understand that theyre going to have to change their minds.

They were joined by Frans Kaashoek, an associate professor at M.I.T., who has been in charge of the anonymous remailer since it began operating in 1996. An anonymous remailer, a type of data-network relay, is essentially a technological buffer, offering confidentiality to its users. It can be used to mask the origin of a piece of E-mail or the computer from which a person is browsing the World Wide Web. It does this by stripping off the identifying information on an E-mail, for example, and substituting an anonymous code number or term. Sophisticated remailers, like the one at M.I.T., also route messages through many different relay computers around the world, leaving no record of the path an"}

Sophisticated remailers, like the one at M.I.T., also route messages through many different relay computers around the world, leaving no record of the path an anonymous message traveled after leaving the remailer. But computer experts have occasionally tracked messages from remailers, either because a person used an anonymity service incorrectly or because of security flaws in a remailer. There are about 40 anonymous remail services worldwide. They are used by, among others, dissidents and human rights representatives in nations with repressive governments, whistle-blowers in companies or government agencies, minority groups fearing discrimination and people simply wishing to avoid the bulk E-mail advertising that marketers increasingly send over the Net. In Kosovo, some people with on-line connections have started using anonymous remail services to try to maintain confidential communications and avoid detection by the Serbian military. But anonymous remail services, Federal prosecutors say, are also used by child pornographers, extortionists, software pirates and drug dealers.

Though not illegal, remailers are often viewed with suspicion by law enforcement agencies. They occupy a gray area in cyberspace, and Mr. Kaashoek good-naturedly underscored that fact by wearing a black ski mask for much of the panel discussion. After his opening, Mr. Reitinger turned to his theme. Anonymity has a down side to it, he said. Its hard to put a pseudonym in jail. There are not a lot of indictments that say, United States of America versus John Doe. If people are truly anonymous, there can be no law enforcement. Mr. Reitinger and Ms. Strossen have debated these issues in the past, so their early exchanges had the practiced rhythms of old sparring partners. Her opening salvo: Weve got to make sure that freedom of speech, freedom of the press and privacy are as protected in cyberspace as they are in the rest of life.

Certain individual rights cannot be sacrificed because of the panic and fears of abuse of a new technology, or because it creates problems for law enforcement. Mr. Reitinger, a senior counsel in the Justice Departments computer crime and intellectual property division, agreed that the Internet had made his life more difficult. Trying to trace a path of criminal communications often involves working with authorities in 8 to 20 nations, he observed. Anonymous remailers can make that tracing far more difficult, if not impossible. Mr. Kaashoek said M.I.T. had received several subpoenas from state and Federal authorities since the universitys remailer was set up in 1996. M.I.T., he said, has answered the subpoenas but he noted that typically the tracking information it can offer involves only one leg of a many-legged path of communication.

As a medium, the Internet does seem unique in the way that it magnifies the issues of privacy and anonymity. The problem is that this technology is just so darned powerful, said Paul Saffo, a director of the Institute for the Future. It makes it easy to be anonymous, but it can also make it far easier to track people down and invade their privacy. Mr. Saffo did not attend the debate, but both Ms. Strossen and Mr. Reitinger addressed the point that Internet technology has raised the stakes on matters of privacy. Both agreed that the technology poses difficult challenges, though they approached the subject from understandably different vantage points. Ms. Strossen said she was very concerned that new software technology allows corporations or governments to track a persons every mouse click and to assemble vast digital dossiers on individuals.

The technologies of anonymity and cryptography may be the only way to protect privacy. To which Mr. Reitinger replied: I think we are perilously close to a lose-lose situation in which citizens have lost their privacy to commercial interests and criminals have easy access to absolute anonymity. Thats not a world we want. There was scattered clapping for various remarks made during the debate, but that comment from Mr. Reitinger was greeted with sustained applause. Sophisticated criminals, of course, will always have access to the latest technology, whether cars or software.

(Ed Quinn for The New York Times) Chart: Internet Stealth People use anonymous remailers to send E-mail messages, trying to mask the identity of the original sender. There are about 40 remailers around the world. 1. Messages can be sent to the anonymous remailer by anyone, from anywhere. Some remailers assign I.D. number to users, a list of which is kept by the remailer administrator. 2. A remailer receives an incoming message, automatically strips off all traces of the senders identity and then forwards the message -- to a single electronic mail box, or to thousands of addresses or to other remailers. 3. Because the messages are remailed in a random sequence different from the order in which they arrive, people who may be monitoring the remailers cannot match the outgoing messages with the incoming messages to identify who sent which message.

Like leading firms in many industries, Merrill has been struggling to find a way to compete with cheaper on-line upstarts. From bookstores to travel agencies, companies must decide how much to risk their existing large and profitable businesses in order to do battle with small, unprofitable but rapidly growing Internet competitors. Merrill, which has more brokers and assets than any other such firm, has for years held the line, arguing that customers would be willing to pay its higher fees for superior service and in-depth analysis. But ultimately it decided that Internet trading was neither a fad nor a small segment of the market. Indeed, 6.3 million households trade stocks over the Internet, and they account for one in every seven stock trades in the country.

But those customers will not get access to research or guidance from a broker. Alternately, customers can pay an annual fee of at least $1,500 for unlimited trading and advice, either on line or through a broker. We could see just by observing the growth of Schwabs asset base that there was a segment of the market that wants to use technology and only technology, said David H. Komansky, Merrills chairman. While a few of the other traditional full-service brokerage firms have introduced on-line trading in one or another form, analysts say that most of them will have to go much further to match Merrill, along with Schwab and the on-line brokers.

Two other full-service firms have low-cost Internet units -- Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter -- but they have segregated them from their full-service operations. Merrills approach, by contrast, invites clients to have both traditional accounts and discount Internet trading accounts at the same time, with trades from either reported on one statement. Merrill considered a separate Internet unit as well but decided it needed to reach out to its existing customers because an increasing number had already opened an account with an on-line competitor to try Internet trading on their own."}

FORD JR., the new 42-year-old chairman of the Ford Motor Company, became an environmentalist the way many baby boomers did. As a boy, he loved to hike, fish and go camping; he hated to revisit a spot only to find that someone else had made a mess of it. In high school, he volunteered to spend afternoons picking up trash along a nearby river. At Princeton University, he read books by radical environmentalists and stayed up late discussing how to save the earth. Then he joined the family business as a vehicle-planning analyst in 1979, and got a shock when he tried to raise environmental concerns. Coming to an old-line auto company, people looked at me like I was a Bolshevik for bringing it up, for even asking the questions, he said. Whether the problems were air and water pollution from factories, or tailpipe emissions from the cars that came off the assembly lines, managers then had no interest in taking action, Mr. Ford said.

As Fords director of business strategy in the early 1990s, he sent out a memorandum calling a meeting on environmental policy -only to be warned immediately by the companys lawyers that even writing the memorandum, much less holding the meeting, could be used against Ford in an environmental lawsuit. On several occasions, Mr. Ford said, he reached the point where he told his wife that he was going to leave the company to form an environmentalist group. My friends and my wife always convinced me that the impact I could have would be far greater if I stayed, said Mr. Ford, sitting in the same conference room where he had held his meeting on environmental policy over the lawyers objections. And they were right, ultimately, but they were more patient than I was.

While car makers are still capable of rousing the ire of environmentalists, notably by increasing their output of gas-guzzling but high-profit sport utility vehicles, attitudes within the industry are slowly but perceptibly changing. A new generation of auto executives is taking charge, one that views environmental values as part of mainstream American life. Some, like Mr. Ford, are relatively young; some are older executives who have moved into the auto industry from other businesses, like detergent manufacturing, that came to terms with environmentalists long ago. While a few foreign auto makers, notably Honda, have touted their environmental records for years, domestic auto makers are just starting to see theirs as a marketing strength, giving them a financial incentive to compete on who can be greenest.

Until recently, virtually all of the auto industrys improvements were forced by Government regulation and were bitterly fought at every turn. To some extent, that is still the case; the industry fiercely opposes any tightening of fuel-economy regulations, for example, despite evidence that gasoline consumption contributes directly to global warming. Yet now, many auto makers are also beginning to look for ways to clean up their factories and the vehicles they sell without waiting for regulators to step in. The main example so far has been Fords decision, beginning with the 1999 model year, to make all its sport utility vehicles roughly as clean as cars, instead of continuing to exploit a loophole in Federal regulations that allows the off-road vehicles to emit several times more pollution per mile than cars do. Ford is also buying junkyards, with a plan to reuse more auto parts instead of letting them clog landfills. Other auto makers are also taking voluntary steps.

All of Hondas American-made Civics and Accords now meet Californias strict emissions standard, and its Odyssey minivan and Passport sport utility vehicle have very low emissions, although the CR-V sport utility does not. DaimlerChrysler is working on a host of initiatives, like working on low-pollution synthetic diesel. And General Motors has spent hundreds of millions of dollars to develop and market an electric car, while helping the Nature Conservancy to buy and then preserve the habitats of rare species. Perhaps most surprisingly, the auto industry did fairly little lobbying against the Clinton Administrations proposal earlier this month to require much lower tailpipe emissions, particularly from sport utility vehicles and pickups. Instead, it demanded, and got, new Federal regulations requiring oil companies to sell much cleaner gasoline -- a decision that will make it easier to produce clean-burning cars, but enraged the oil industry.

Some, like John DeCicco, the transportation program director at the Washington-based American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, are fairly generous. The management of the auto industry is part of our American society, which has internalized environmental values over the last three decades, he said. OTHERS are more dubious. One is Daniel Becker, a vocal critic of the auto industry for nearly a quarter-century, first as an aide to Ralph Nader, and now as the Sierra Clubs director for energy policy and global warming. Mr. Becker said that Fords decision to clean up its sport utility vehicles was the only significant, voluntary step that Detroit had taken in recent decades to improve the environment, and he questioned whether other steps would come soon.

Indeed, with profits on full-size sport utility vehicles running at $12,000 or more apiece, auto makers have increased production and sales in this category more than sixfold since the early 1990s. In terms of policy decisions, in terms of product lines, Mr. Becker said, I dont think the change has started in a dramatic way. Auto industry leaders say they deserve more credit. John G.

He was also skeptical of moves to further reduce tailpipe emissions. The decision to build cleaner-burning sport utilities was led by another top Ford executive, Jacques Nasser, a 51-year-old ally of Mr. Fords. Mr. Trotman retired early this year, and Mr. Nasser replaced him as the companys chief executive; Mr. Ford became chairman. A great-grandson of Henry Fords, he won the familys confidence to run the company, even though he was one of the younger members of the Fords fourth generation.

In an increasingly global economy, Mr. Nasser said, consumers increasingly turn to a few well-known brands, like Volvos small but famous car-making division, which Ford Motor bought earlier this year. At the same time, the rise of the Internet and other forms of communications has made it possible for information about a companys activities in any city to spread quickly all over the world. So to have a popular, global brand that consumers will seek out, a company must be a good corporate citizen everywhere, Mr. Nasser concluded. Brands are becoming more important, and corporate image is becoming more important on a global basis, he said.

Rival auto makers estimate that Fords cleaner sport utility vehicles are costing the company at least $100 million a year, mainly for bigger catalytic converters, an expense Ford says it is not passing on to consumers. While a few other S.U.V.s are being cleaned up, most are not, and rival executives are criticizing Ford for taking action.

With the Expedition and Excursion, Ford has gone to the extremes of consumption, Mr. Robertson said. Mr. Ford said that he understood the criticisms of the Excursion. But he maintained that some auto maker was inevitably going to build such a giant vehicle, and at least Ford was designing it to be as clean as most cars. SUCH excuses do not satisfy Mr. Becker of the Sierra Club, who said that while he believed that Mr. Ford genuinely cared about the environment, he doubted that such views had spread widely through the company.

Many environmentalists believe this to be politically impossible. Some environmentalists also fault the auto industry for not having sold many alternatives to the gasoline-powered car. All of the big auto manufacturers are spending heavily to research alternative technologies, like electric cars, which use batteries or, more recently, fuel cells, which generate electricity by combining hydrogen and oxygen without combustion. Yet alternative-fuel cars have become a chimera that has receded ever further into the future for most of this century. Regulators in California and New York required a decade ago that electric cars be widely available by now. They retreated from that goal, however, as technological advances proved inadequate and as gasoline-powered cars became steadily cleaner. G.

Mr. Smale said G .M. had learned some valuable technological lessons from the EV1, including how to develop better batteries for electric cars. Ford sells most of the alternative-fuel vehicles in the United States, but these are mainly electric and natural gas-powered pickup trucks and vans purchased by utilities and Government agencies. Honda and Toyota plan to appeal to the public soon by selling small cars powered by a combination of a gasoline engine and an electric battery.

They will also have to sell them below the high cost of manufacturing them. Despite lavish Federal subsidies and numerous promises by auto makers to put high-mileage cars on sale by 2004, there is little sign of continuing public interest in fuel economy. This is probably linked to the fact that gasoline is still cheaper than bottled water in most of the country, even though gas prices recently rebounded. The 10 most fuel-efficient cars on the market now account together for less than 1 percent of sales in the United States, while auto makers no longer even bother putting fuel-economy statistics in their advertisements. They have found that such information does not draw customers. BARRING another energy crisis, the main environmental issue in the United States is likely to remain the ever-growing fleet of gasoline-powered cars being driven ever more miles, thereby contributing to smog and global warming.

M.s executive director of advanced technology vehicles. G.M., in particular, used to have a grim reputation for refusing to acknowledge that environmental problems even existed. David Lewis, an automotive historian at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor who worked as a speech writer for two G. M. presidents from 1959 to 1965, said company policy then was to insist it was the oil refineries and other businesses, not cars, that caused air pollution.

Until the last few months, some of the strongest criticisms of environmentalists have come from the former Chrysler Corporation. Robert J. Eaton, the companys chairman, and Robert A. Lutz, the vice chairman, were outspokenly skeptical of claims that global warming might be a problem. A brilliant car designer who resents any criticism of his industry, Mr. Lutz published a business-advice book last year in which he briefly compared environmental extremists to Communists, saying that both sought to eliminate the publics freedom to travel. Mr. Lutz retired last year -- he now runs a car battery company; Mr. Eaton, now a co-chairman of DaimlerChrysler A.G., is expected to retire soon.

Most top-selling foreign cars are fairly fuel-efficient because they were designed in countries where gasoline is expensive. During the 1970s, Japanese auto makers came up with cleaner engines for their small cars at a time when American auto makers were still contending that low-emissions technology was unfeasible. But while foreign cars may be ubiquitous in coastal cities like New York and Los Angeles, they remain less common in the Midwest. G. M. still sells more cars and other family vehicles in the United States each year than every Japanese and European auto maker combined.

They insist that as an older generation of leaders continues to retire, environmental progress will continue. Mr. Ford said that during his 20-year ascent through the company ranks, he was often struck by how many other young managers were worried about the companys environmental performance.

Carleton S.

However, Ms. Fiorina, who now heads a $20 billion division of Lucent, is already one of the nations highest-ranking female executives. And today she sought to play down the issue of gender in her new role. I hope that we are at a point that everyone has figured out that there is not a glass ceiling, she said in response to a reporters question. My gender is interesting but really not the subject of the story here. At the same time, industry analysts said Ms. Fiorinas appointment was a clear statement by Hewlett-Packard -known for its less-than-glitzy engineering culture -- that marketing and sales were taking a front seat.

The move is a striking departure for the big microprocessor producer, known for pumping out millions of silicon Pentium chips that serve as the electronic brains of most personal computers. Analysts say the Intel announcement reflects just how far the company is willing to go in seeking new ways to grow as it recognizes the Internet as both a challenge and an opportunity. This is a stretch, but you have to give Intels management credit for recognizing that the world is rapidly changing around them and trying to do something about it, said Drew Peck, a managing director of S.

Intel presented its plans for the data farms at a meeting with securities analysts yesterday in New York. Though Intels profits have held up well so far, many analysts believe that the rise of the Internet will inevitably erode its margins.

The proliferation of these so-called Internet appliances, they note, will not replace personal computers by any means. But the Internet will fuel more diverse computing technologies and other access devices. This in turn will undermine the profits of the technology standard-bearers in the PC-centric era, that is, Intel and the Microsoft Corporation, whose Windows operating system runs most PCs.

While Qwest Communications International Inc., perhaps the best-known new long-distance carrier, and older brethren like the AT&T Corporation use a range of communications technologies in their networks, Level 3 is trying a pure Internet approach. That requires finding ways to transmit not only Web pages but also phone calls and video signals using Internet technology. Level 3 is using mostly high-speed Internet switches made by Cisco Systems Inc., the data communications giant, in the core of its network. But Level 3 has turned to Lucent, the former equipment arm of AT&T, to help replicate the strengths of the traditional telephone network using Internet technology. Level 3 signed up as the first big company to use a new product that Lucent calls a softswitch.

Fisher should feel pretty glum right about now. This is the man, after all, who in 1993 was hailed as the Eastman Kodak Companys shining star. Fresh from a successful stint as Motorolas chief, he was expected to steer Kodak from the frightened old-style photography company it had become into a robust, hugely profitable player in the digital imaging age. Those first few years, it seemed all systems were go. Mr. Fisher was an absolute hero in Rochester, a city whose economic fortunes and self-image have long been tied to Kodak. Strangers would greet him in restaurants and markets, the local news media recorded his every move, and the national press -- along with numerous consultants and professors -- placed him up with John F. Welch Jr. of General Electric and Lawrence A. Bossidy of AlliedSignal among the premier management movers of the 1990s. But Mr. Fisher never fulfilled that promise at Kodak. When Daniel A.

Its mainstay business, conventional photography, is under competitive siege from Fuji Photo Film of Japan. And even though the Japanese yen has risen in value, making Kodak more competitive against Fuji, the continued strength of the dollar against most other currencies keeps eating away at its overseas profits. Consequently, Kodaks share price is mired; its stock topped $80 a couple of times during Mr. Fishers tenure, but always dropped precipitously again. Kodak shares closed at $63.4375 on Thursday.

I should be getting high marks for managing a succession plan that was smooth as ice, yet everyone is looking for subplots. The fact is, some board members just didnt want me to leave, period. Indeed, in a conversation in his Rochester offices, as a bright winter sun bathed his face -- Im a child of the sun, Ill take the window side in a plane just to enjoy the glare, he said with a laugh -- Mr. Fisher seemed anything but shaken or contrite.

Goizueta, then chief executive of Coca-Cola and a Kodak board member, to take Kodaks top job in 1993, the company was a mess. It was mired in debt. It had haphazardly diversified into pharmaceuticals and other areas it knew little about. Its growth, save the revenues it added on with ill-starred acquisitions, was flat. It was a high-cost manufacturer, with a bloated staff and a sleepy culture that was slow to make decisions.

Mr. Fisher believes he has done just that. He notes that today, Kodak is focused on pictures, nothing else. It is nearly 20,000 jobs lighter, and a lot nimbler, thanks in part to a set of culture-changing incentives that reward managers for fast decisions and even faster execution. Roughly a third of its senior managers are new in their jobs; the board includes many more outsiders.

Through Internet partnerships that let customers receive electronic versions of their photos by e-mail, through kiosks that let them manipulate and reproduce old photographs, and through archival services that let users store their photographs on CD-ROMs or on the Internet, Kodak has managed not only to salvage its profitable chemical-based photography business, it has added a technological veneer to it.

As you look back over the last six years, are there memories that make you wince? A. 1997 was my year from hell. Everything went wrong. We lost the World Trade Organization decision [regarding Japans market for photographic film]; the currency went south; the health organizations got aggressive in purchasing medical films; our CD-ROM prices collapsed; our leading film competitor got aggressive in pricing. Even our race car started losing all its races! There were days I wondered whether there was some gravitational field from the outer universe impinging on us.

This low, unassuming building houses some of the more unusual work being done in this teeming valley of technology. Inside PARC (which stands for Palo Alto Research Center), the offices are comfortable, almost domestic in scale (not stark, arid cubicles) and tastefully decorated in a style more reminiscent of subdued northern California ranch-style homes than of high-tech corporations.

In 1993, Mr. Gold, with help from his colleagues, started PAIR, the PARC Artists-in-Residence Program, under which innovative Bay Area artists worked in teams with about a dozen scientists at Xerox PARC.

Pure research, rather than specific product development, was the goal that both Mr. Gold and the management had in mind. (A rather unusual idea in a traditional corporate profit-making structure.) Two committees were formed to select the artists. The first was made up of Xerox PARC scientists; the second, according to Mr. Gold, consisted of Bay Area art curators, gallery owners, heads of art departments, as well as people from Theater Artaud and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, all in an effort to get as much of a range as we could.

In the mid-1960s, Billy Kluver, an engineer of Swedish origin working at Bell Laboratories in Murray Hill, N.J., became interested in the New York art world and in particular the work of Pop artists. He started a program in which engineers from Bell met with artists like Jean Tinguely, Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns, Merce Cunningham, John Cage, Andy Warhol and many others. Through these collaborative pairings, Mr. Kluver along with Mr. Rauschenberg, Fred Waldhauer and Robert Whitman started a program called Experiments in Art and Technology, or E.A.T., in 1966. SOME of the results of the E.A.T. collaborations, like Warhols floating silver pillows and Mr. Rauschenbergs robots, were included in World Expo 70 in Osaka, Japan.

The San Jose Museum of Art in California is currently working on an interactive CD-ROM on the history of this period. Naturally, when Mr. Gold thought of setting up a program linking artists and scientists at Xerox, he called Mr. Kluver for advice. Mr. Kluver at first discouraged Mr. Gold from undertaking the pairings, saying that artists and scientists were perhaps too similar in nature to be able to work productively together. He thought the only workable match would be between artists and engineers, seeing the engineers as the facilitators of the artists work.

However, it soon became apparent that this was not a realistic time frame. Most of the artists ended up close friends with the scientists and stayed in contact and worked with them for three to four years. Judy Malloy was one of the first artists to work in PAIR. She started in November 1993 with an office at PARC and access to the computer science labs. Ms. Malloy, a Bay Area hypertext writer, worked with the scientist Pavel Curtis on a project called Brown House Kitchen, a narrative written by Ms. Malloy to accompany a text-based virtual-reality site created at PARC by Mr. Curtis.

Ms. Malloy also worked with Cathy Marshal, a hypertext researcher, on a project called Forward Anywhere. Ms. Malloy and Ms. Marshals relationship started via E-mail as a way of getting to know each other. Both women had been using hypertext, which, according to Ms. Malloy, is the way in which the reader navigates information on the Web by following/choosing links rather than moving sequentially. This way of reading, she continues, allows for choices that determine the way the story unfolds, allowing each reader to see a different narrative.

For example, the collaborative artist team of Jeanne C. Finley and John H. Muse recall that at Xerox PARC we were paired with members of the Work Practice and Technology area, W.P.T., a small group of anthropologists lead by Lucy Suchman, and computer scientists who study work and the practices by which workers take up technologies in creative and necessarily unpredictable ways. They said, in writing: W.P.T. also uses video and interview-observation in their research. We shared not only technologies but also a concern for the ethical implications of using them to create and distribute images, texts and stories.

Among their many projects together, this team, working under the name C.M.M.W., produced Nightfall, a hypertextual multimedia installation that was shown at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco.

Pamela Z, a performance and sound artist, was paired with the researchers Michael Black and David Levy. Through their conversations, three audio works emerged.

The other article, in The Post, noted that Amazon.com was shipping an extraordinary number of copies of Adolf Hitlers racist manifesto, Mein Kampf, to buyers in Germany. It is illegal to sell Mein Kampf in bookstores in Germany or publish it there.

With the first phase of this wall-destroying Internet revolution -- the e-mail and e-commerce phase -- now fully under way, I posed that question to John Chambers. Mr. Chambers runs Cisco Systems, which makes the routers that run the Internet. Beware: He has an obvious stake in touting the Internet. But note: His past predictions have proved extremely accurate.

Once a C.E.O. understands that absorbing the Net into every aspect of his or her business is the only way they are going to survive, said Mr. Chambers, they are going to be spending big bucks on it. Thats why I believe that Y2K will be short-lived, and after that we are going to see one of the best years the computer industry has ever seen. So now that commerce has moved to the Net, and the Net is moving into business, what comes after that? Education, said Mr. Chambers.

What will drive it will be the demands on companies, in an intensely competitive global economy, to keep improving productivity. E-learning, insists Mr. Chambers, if done right, can provide faster learning, at lower costs, with more accountability, thereby enabling both companies and schools to keep up with changes in the global economy that now occur at Net speed. Schools and countries that ignore this, he says, will suffer the same fate as big department stores that thought e-commerce was overrated. If universities move properly, they will offer the ideal combination of online and instructor-led learning, argues Mr. Chambers. But if universities dont reinvent their curriculums and how they deliver them, for an increasingly Net-driven economy, many students, particularly in information technology fields, will go to schools online, he says.

But for more than a decade, most of the nations leading economists have been heretics. You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics, Robert M. Solow, a Nobel Prize winner from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, once said. For years, even as the computer revolutionized the workplace, measured productivity -- the output of goods and services per worker -- stagnated, barely advancing 1 percent a year. So it is easy to see how Mr. Solows pithy comment became the favorite punch line of the economic naysayers. Yet today, even renowned skeptics on the subject of technologys contribution to the economy, like Mr. Solow, are having second thoughts.

That has drawn attention because past upward swings in productivity typically occurred early in a recovery as economic activity rebounded. Once companies increased hiring, it slowed again. But something seems fundamentally different this time. It apparently relates to the increased speed and efficiency that information technology advances -- including the Internet -- is finally bringing to the mundane day-to-day tasks of millions of businesses. The question, posed by economists, is whether the higher productivity growth averaging about 2 percent in the last three years, roughly double the pace from 1973 to 1995, is the long-awaited confirmation that the nations steadily rising investment in computers and communications is finally paying off. The evidence is starting to point in that direction. My beliefs are shifting on this subject, Mr. Solow said. I am still far from certain.

His work, along with another Fed economist, Stephen D. Oliner, in 1994, and on his own in 1997, found that computers contributed little to economic growth. But recently, Mr. Sichel ran similar calculations for the last few years and came to a different conclusion. In a paper that has just been published in the quarterly Business Economics, he wrote that his new work points to a striking step up in the contribution of computers to output growth.

If the recent gains are not just a temporary blip, it suggests that the Federal Reserve can be less fearful of inflation and keep interest rates stable rather than be forced to raise them to cool off what would otherwise be considered an overheated economy. The Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, and the other Fed governors are scheduled to hear presentations on information technologys effect on the economy from several academics during a private meeting in Washington tomorrow.

These are the competitive advantages of information technology, he said. We need a broader definition of output in this new economy, which goes beyond the industrial-era concept of widgets coming off the assembly line. The Government, after years of defending its figures, conceded two weeks ago that productivity growth may be understated. The core of the problem, Government economists say, is the increasingly complex challenge of defining and measuring output in much of the economys fast-growing service sector, which includes the vast reaches of banking, finance, health care and education.

Edwin R. Dean, chief of the productivity division of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, wrote in a recent research paper that the agency is increasingly concerned that its measurements do not fully reflect changes in the quality of goods and services or capture the full impact of new technology on economic performance. Still, the Governments methods of measurement will not be overhauled anytime soon. These are tough, tough questions and we are not going to get instant solutions, Mr. Dean said in an interview.

And that is only the hardware. There have been surges in corporate spending on software, consulting, technical support and training related to the field. The payoff from information technology is unquestionably there with individual companies and were seeing it over and over again, said Chuck Rieger, a senior consultant at I.B.M.s services division. Of course, anecdotal evidence from individual companies is no proof of broad-based benefits in an $8.5 trillion economy. But what many experts find encouraging is that the rapid introduction of low-cost Internet technology means most companies can now afford to set up electronic links with customers and suppliers.

This is not the glamorous side of Internet commerce, occupied by Amazon.com and others selling consumer products. Yet if a technology dividend in productivity is at hand, the place to look is in the back offices of business. That is where it will be, Mr. Solow, the M.I.T economist, said, in the wholesale automation of corporate transactions. This business-to-business commerce over the Internet is projected to jump from $48 billion in 1998 to $1.5 trillion by 2003, according to Forrester Research Inc.

In Chicago, Michael Rushmore, a banker, said Internet computing has fundamentally changed the way we do business over the last three or four years. An example of this is the way corporate loans are syndicated among many banks, said Mr. Rushmore, who is a managing director of Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities, the securities arm of the BankAmerica Corporation. Until about two years ago, syndicating a large corporate bank loan meant distributing a lengthy offering document, often running more than 200 pages, to 50 to 100 banks. It was, Mr. Rushmore recalled, a nightmarish, inefficient process that involved waves of overnight mail, constant faxing and armies of messengers. Today, much of that process is handled over the Internet on bank Web sites that other banks tap into to read and download the offering document, ask questions and exchange views.

The rapid spread of Internet-based computing, experts say, promises to compress the time it takes for any new technology to enhance economic welfare in general. The classic study of the phenomenon, The Dynamo and the Computer: An Historical Perspective on the Modern Productivity Paradox, by Paul David, an economic historian at Stanford University, was published in 1990.

Sure, they concede, there has been surprisingly strong productivity growth for the last three years. Could this represent a break in the trend? Possibly, they grudgingly admit, but only a tiny shift at best. The real problem, they say, lies in the composition of the nations vast service economy. More than half of all white-collar workers are what they term knowledge workers -- managers, executives and professionals like doctors, lawyers, teachers, even economists.

The phenomenon, known as Moores Law for the semiconductor pioneer who first observed it, has been the basic force underlying the computer revolution and the rise of the Internet. As transistors have been scaled ever smaller, computing performance has risen exponentially while the cost of that power has been driven down. And it has been assumed in the industry that the rate of progress would hold for at least another 10 to 15 years. But now a researcher at Intel, the worlds leading chip company, has reported glimpsing a potentially insurmountable barrier to the advance of Moores Law much closer at hand, perhaps early in the coming decade.

The report by the Intel scientist will be echoed by researchers from the University of Glasgow in a paper to be presented in December at a conference in Washington.

On what grounds? Because Goldman had advised an investor in Orange of Britain, a wireless company Mannesmann itself wanted. But the court called the suit hopeless, refusing to censure Goldman for having too many of a good thing -- clients. In the end, the episode underscored what investment bankers had known all along: Goldman Sachs had become a dominant force in the redrawing of Europes telecommunications map. Chalk it up to the appetites of acquisition-hungry Europeans eager to expand their network empires -- and to Goldmans years of positioning itself to direct and underwrite that action. This year, Goldman has been an adviser on $239 billion of telecommunications mergers in Europe.

The Goldman strategy is if it was owned by the government, take it private, said Howard Anderson, chairman of the Yankee Group, a telecommunications research firm. If it is private, take it public. Then merge it. They are a transaction machine. Consider the case of Spains Terra Networks S.A., a provider of Internet access and content in Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking countries, which Goldman took public last month and whose market value reached $13.9 billion as of last Friday.

In 1998, for instance, Goldman advised the Ameritech Corporation, the Chicago-based telephone company, on its purchase of a 34.4 percent stake in another Goldman client, Denmarks state-owned TeleDanmark, for $3.1 billion. That deal led to Goldmans advising Ameritech on its sale earlier this year to SBC Communications Inc., Mr. Mead said. This year, however, if any company has put Goldman on the map in Europe it has been Vodafone AirTouch. Few people in the United States had even heard of the company until last January, when it defeated Bell Atlantic in a bidding contest to buy AirTouch Communications, one of the largest American cellular phone companies, for $77 billion.

Vodafone executives knew Goldman as far back as 1988, when the firm helped with the spinoff of Vodafone from Racal Electronics, a military-electronics company. In the early going, Goldman did not conduct much business for Vodafone because the telecommunications company was not actively pursuing deals, said Christopher Gent, Vodafones chief executive. In fact, Goldman nearly lost the account altogether when it played lead banker for the 1996 initial stock offering of a Vodafone competitor, Orange, without conferring with Vodafone. To make amends, Mr. Gent said, Goldmans chief executive at the time, Jon S. Corzine, called him personally to apologize. We came to an understanding early on of what was expected of them, Mr. Gent recalled. I expected them to commit to us. It was not long before Mr. Mead began to call on Mr. Gent personally.

To survive in a global market, Mr. Gent said, we had to do it by transactions, not by being stealth. Goldman leaped into action, dispatching teams from both Europe and the United States to begin working up a strategy with Vodafone, resulting in the AirTouch and Bell Atlantic forays and the ongoing effort to take control of Mannesmann. But even Mr. Gent is mindful of the risk Goldman has taken by choosing to represent his company in the Mannesmann battle.

Last January, Mr. Harrison, a longtime Goldman partner and friend of Mr. Meads since their university days in Britain in the late 1970s, joined him at Mr. Meads invitation to co-head the communications, media and entertainment group. Through the spring, over several dinners in Manhattan at Provence in SoHo and other French bistros, and through frequent trips between New York and London, the two mapped out their groups strategy for adapting to a fast-changing telecommunications world. First, the Mr. Mead and Mr. Harrison decided that Goldmans 175 telecommunications bankers worldwide should focus on two types of concerns: super league telecommunications companies, of which they say there are some 60 worldwide, including the likes of Vodafone and Deutsche Telekom; as well as emerging telecom companies.

Right now it is a question of finding them. And it is a question of whether Goldman can service them. Goldman has always been strong in merger advice and taking companies public. But high-yield finance -- debt financing with sufficient risk that investors demand a higher interest rate -- has never been Goldmans forte. Hoping to change that, Goldman recently hired David Solomon, a noted Wall Street rainmaker and former co-head of investment banking at Bear, Stearns, to help lead its newly expanded global high-yield banking business. Steve Galbraith, an investment banking and brokerage analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, is one of many in the industry who are closely watching Goldmans high-yield effort.

It will be interesting to see if this strategy works out. And in a nod to the colliding worlds of technology, telecommunications and media, Goldmans global communication group has set up a joint venture with its technology team to represent Internet companies and telecommunications equipment makers. It is not unusual for technology and telecommunications bankers to cross paths, but until now they have typically called on clients separately in order to protect lucrative fiefs. If Goldmans approach is successful, other investment banks might be tempted to follow suit. If not, Goldman may find its bankers divided by turf battles that could leave the firm vulnerable to competitors all too happy to swoop in and steal business.

Paul Maritz, the highest-ranking executive appearing as a witness at the Microsoft antitrust trial, portrayed the discussions with the Netscape Communications Corporation in 1995 as mainly an effort to find common ground between the two companies. But the Government maintains that a June 1995 meeting was a crucial episode in its sweeping antitrust case. After Netscape rejected Microsofts proposal, the Government contends, Microsoft embarked on what the prosecution regards as a pattern of practices intended to thwart competition. David Boies, the Justice Departments lead trial lawyer, presented several Microsoft E-mails written shortly before the Netscape meeting saying that Microsoft wanted to make sure Netscapes software for browsing the World Wide Web did not become a technology platform for which software programmers would write applications -making it a potential alternative to Microsofts industry-standard Windows operating system.

But in some of the sharpest questioning since the trial began last October, Mr. Boies persistently asked an elusive Mr. Maritz about the implications of Microsofts proposal. If Netscape had agreed to shift its focus away from software that Microsoft deemed mainstream to its strategic interests, he asked, would Netscape have become a less significant platform threat? That, Mr. Maritz conceded, was partly true. At one level, yes, he said.

That was five years ago. At the time, Japan was aghast at the idea of freeing up a market that was a groggy backwater. Japanese citizens were not even allowed to own cellular phones -- just rent them -- and Japanese companies were afraid that they were going to lose business to American rivals like Motorola. Yet Japan buckled, and now, under the pressure of competition, it has leap-frogged to the front of the global pack. The country now has a higher concentration of cellular telephones -- including ones colored pink, pale blue or tea-green -- than does the United States. More astonishing, Japan has caught up with Europe, the early pace setter, and plans to move ahead in 2001 by introducing the third generation of cellular phone technology, which promises much greater clarity and ability to transmit data and video.

Moreover, as in Europe, they have leaped into the digital era under the umbrella of compatibility -- unlike in the United States, where competing technologies have actually stifled the advance of seamless and ubiquitous communication. The latest mobile phone to draw oohs and aahs here has a tiny camera that sends a shaky TV-style color image to a small screen on the other partys telephone -- assuming that it too is a video phone.

While its revenue has declined, profit margins have increased recently, not fallen. CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES THURSDAY OCTOBER 28, 1999 AT&T, the nations most widely held stock, posted quarterly results yesterday that exceeded analysts expectations and underscored the increasing importance in the communications industry of new services at the expense of traditional products. AT&Ts earnings beat estimates by a penny a share, but the companys overall profit declined largely because of a dilution of its stock caused by the acquisition of Tele-Communications Inc., the cable TV giant. Strong growth in the AT&T units that provide wireless phone service and that serve the complex communication needs of big businesses was largely offset by continued declines in the companys core consumer long-distance business. Over all, AT&T demonstrated healthy revenue growth, especially compared with anemic revenue performance in recent years.

With a nod to nostalgia for the mythic gadget-laden spycraft of the James Bond era, the agency has named its new nonprofit venture In-Q-It, in a reference to Major Boothroyd, a.k.a. Q, the master technologist whose basement laboratory develops advanced gadgets for the fictional British super-agent. It will be headed by Gilman Louie, an executive in the Hasbro toy companys on-line business group. The decision by the nations spy agency to turn to Silicon Valley for technology assistance underscores the growing diversity of high-tech companies and the accelerated development of computer technologies. Unlike in the cold war, when the most advanced technologies trickled down from a handful of supercomputer companies, the most powerful technologies are increasingly being developed"}

Unlike in the cold war, when the most advanced technologies trickled down from a handful of supercomputer companies, the most powerful technologies are increasingly being developed first by consumer electronics companies that now have vast markets to finance the developments of powerful systems and applications. In-Q-It is being financed with $28 million appropriated last year by Congress as part of the C.I.A.s budget, which is classified. The company will seek joint projects and investments in crucial technology areas. There is a tremendous information explosion today, said John McMahon, former deputy director of the C.I.A. and an In-Q-It board member. As a result, the agency was always one step behind. The agency got the idea that maybe what it needed was something that would not only appreciate its needs but be an umbilical cord that was plugged in to the brightest minds in the Valley.

The technology world has totally changed, and one day the C.I.A. woke up and realized they needed to go through the same change. The new company will supply venture capital in some cases, and in others it will hire contractors or partner with entrepreneurs in four areas: integrating Internet technology and applications into the C.I.A.s work; developing new security and privacy technologies; nurturing data mining technologies to take better advantage of the agencys vast storehouses of records, and modernizing the agencys computer systems.

That stands in striking contrast to the agencys past approach to high-tech projects. For many years there have been reports that the United States intelligence community created shell companies when it had a particular high-technology problem to solve. Indeed, the C.I.A. worked secretly with Howard Hughes during the 1970s when it needed to develop specialized salvage technology to retrieve a sunken Soviet nuclear submarine in the Pacific Ocean. While In-Q-It will operate on a nonprofit basis, Mr. Louie said his intention was to invest in such a way as to make the organization self-sustaining. Jeffrey H.

Mr. Louie said that while this was not the first effort to find innovative ways to move new technologies quickly to the Governments needs, he believed it was the first time a Government agency had adopted a venture financing effort that mimicked a private sector model. Venture capitalists said today that the problem the C.I.A. faces is a challenge faced every day by large organizations: attempting to keep up with the nimble pace of the Valleys technology start-up companies. A number of large multinational companies have in recent years set up investment funds in the valley in an effort to tap into the entrepreneurial spirit of the region. There are a number of models on which the jury is still out, said James Breyer, managing partner of Accel Partners, a venture firm in Palo Alto, Calif.

Companies like Lucent Technologies and the AT&T Corporation have become venture investors in the valley in recent years, he noted, and SRI Research International had less success in trying to spin out its research projects with an internal venture arm. The most important aspect is to have an outstanding outside management effort overseeing the process, he said. It appears in this effort the C.I.A. has chosen well. Previous Government efforts at financing technology have been highly focused efforts to promote the development of specific technologies either needed to keep the nation competitive or to meet national security needs. For example, during the 1970s through 90s various military research agencies like the Defense Advanced Research Projects agency and the Office of Naval Research financed academic and corporate projects not as investments but as contract research. In the early 1990s, the Government financed the Sematech computer consortium in an effort to maintain an independent semiconductor equipment industry in the United States, which was being"}

Nortel, formerly called Northern Telecom, is North Americas second-largest maker of traditional telecommunications equipment, behind Lucent Technologies Inc. Nortel and Lucent are locked in battle not only with each other but also with leaders in data networking, including Cisco Systems Inc., to develop technology for unified voice and data networks. Such unified networks could allow companies to reduce the amount they spend maintaining separate voice and data systems, and could even open the door to new sorts of services, such as phones that communicate with address book software. Developing so-called Internet telephony technology requires big engineering commitments, and Nortel has recently appeared to lag in that effort behind Lucent, Cisco and small Internet telephony start-ups like Vocaltec Communications Ltd. and the Clarent Corporation. Some of the products that Nortel intends to introduce today will not be commercially available for another year or so, but the announcement seems sure to add momentum"}

Some of the products that Nortel intends to introduce today will not be commercially available for another year or so, but the announcement seems sure to add momentum to Nortels efforts to become a leader in Internet telephony. While data networking companies like Cisco have appeared more aggressive in encouraging customers to anticipate scrapping their traditional phone networks in favor of more advanced Internet-based systems, older companies like Lucent and Nortel have encouraged a more evolutionary approach. That approach is geared to appeal to companies that could be concerned about the reliability and capabilities of Internet phone systems. The fact is that most alternatives offered to customers for telephony over I.P. have been very primitive in the features they offer, said James R. Long, president of the Nortel group that sells products to business customers, referring to Internet protocol, the language of cyberspace.

That spectrum of products ranges from Internet add-ons for existing office phone systems made by Nortel, which will be available immediately, to phone systems designed around Internet technology from the ground up, which are not scheduled to become available until the second quarter of next year. If Nortel meets that goal, it will find itself in roughly the same ball park as its major competitors. Cisco wants to deploy Internet-based office phone systems broadly early next year. Lucent plans to sell Internet-based phone systems for small customers this fall and to expand the products for large companies early next year."}

Mr. Long said that among the institutional customers that have agreed to try Nortels Internet phone technology are the University of Texas at Austin; Countrywide Credit Industries, the mortgage company; Kinkos Inc., the copy shop chain; Safeway Inc., the supermarket company, and the Symantec Corporation, the software maker. But developing systems for business customers is only part of the Internet telephony equation. The other big part is developing Internet phone technology for communications carriers like the AT&T Corporation. Nortels competitors seem slightly ahead in that part of the industry, but the Internet telephony market for carriers is immature and the eventual technology winners remain undetermined."}

Yesterday, Qwest was close to a partnership worth as much as $1 billion with Cisco Systems Inc., the leading maker of data communications gear. Under the agreement, Cisco will supply equipment while the two companies jointly develop advanced communications services based on Internet technology. The deal is structured so that Qwest pays only for equipment that is actually in use, executives close to the deal said. That could allow Qwest to better manage its cash flow by paying only for gear that is generating revenue rather than for truckloads of equipment that might not be put into use for weeks or months. The value of the deal could fluctuate depending on customers acceptance of the new system and services, the executives added.

Cisco may well get most of Qwests spending on Internet gear, but Qwest has not said it will build an all-Internet-based network -- something a rival long-distance carrier, Level 3 Communications Inc., has said it plans to do.

Delta 3 is one of the leaders in the still-developing field known as Internet telephony -- a technique for carrying phone calls using Internet systems that whatever the sound quality so far, can be more efficient than traditional telephone networks. Many analysts expect Internet technology to become one of the main means for carrying phone calls as more communications companies focus their networks on Internet-based data, audio and video applications. In order to attract eyeballs and to provide more products and services, we decided to give Delta 3 the ability to do financing on their own, Itzhak Fisher, RSLs chief executive, said on Friday. RSL, which is registered in Bermuda but has its operating headquarters in New York, is a small but fast-growing company focused on selling international communications to small and medium-sized business customers. The letters RSL are the initials of the companys controlling shareholder, Ronald S. Lauder, the cosmetics heir."}

Mr. Fisher would not say how much money the company hoped to raise in the offering, but RSL plans to offer 20 percent of the Internet telephony operation to the public and to retain the rest. RSL plans to file registration documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission by next month and to offer Delta 3 shares to the public in the third quarter. So far, the Net2Phone unit of the publicly held IDT Corporation, based in Hackensack, N.J., is considered the biggest Internet telephony operation. IDT has not announced any plans to issue separate stock for Net2Phone. Most of the other Internet phone companies are small and still private, which would position the Delta 3 offering as perhaps the first pure play investment in Internet telephony.

But the business case for Internet telephony is in flux. In the past, transmitting international phone calls using Internet technology was profitable because carriers could avoid the high tariffs levied by many foreign countries on traditional phone calls. The arbitrage between high tariffs on normal phone calls and no or low tariffs on Internet communications enabled Internet-based companies to undercut traditional carriers and still make money. Sensing this opportunity, RSL acquired a controlling stake in Delta 3 in 1997 and the entire company last year. But those foreign phone fees are coming down, partly as a result of global trade agreements, and the arbitrage opportunity is fading. So RSL has been trying to reposition Delta 3 as something other than a bargain-basement option for budget-sensitive consumers.

It has worked for us for the last two years very well and it will continue to work for us in some countries. But now we will be offering value-added services. Among the services Delta 3 aims to provide are phone calls from computers and billing on the Web. Last week, RSL announced quarterly financial results that were better than most analysts had expected. The company reported a loss of $57 million, or $1.08 a share.

Sweepstakes and contests are time-honored approaches to the marketing of consumer products and services. On a grand scale, these games are time-sensitive advertising campaigns meant to prompt a specific action by consumers by offering the lure of enormous winnings. Sweepstakes and contests, which require contestants to fill out forms with personal information, have also been used by marketers to generate new leads and mailing lists. Before the rise of the Internet, sweepstakes and contests were all about what marketing people call branding. On line, the objectives are to attract traffic to the site and to collect personal information.

The trial is by no means over, but it will sharply shift gears as the daily theater in the courtroom gives way to a more sober weighing of facts and law. Now the showmanship ends and the legal maneuvering really begins, said Andrew I. Gavil, a Howard University law professor. Today the Government got in a parting shot by introducing an E-mail from William H. Gates, Microsofts chairman, that appeared to contradict a central defense contention: that America Online was in a position to challenge Microsofts dominance of operating systems for personal computers. [Page C4.] Most of the points in the courtroom drama went to the Justice Department and 19 states suing the Microsoft Corporation, alleging that it illegally used its dominance to thwart competition.

Even William H. Neukom, Microsofts general counsel, has found the Government performance impressive, if not convincing. Since the start of the trial, Mr. Neukom notes he has fielded expressions of concern that things are going badly for the company from many of his colleagues, even his wife. The Government has put on a great performance, he said, but it does not add up to a solid antitrust case. Its all fluff legally. Joel I.

Both Microsoft and the Government will make further written and oral arguments over the summer and fall. Judge Jackson must then comb through the mountains of evidence to try to answer one essential question: What are the appropriate legal restraints on the behavior of a powerful company in a dynamic high-technology industry? The issue extends well beyond the Microsoft case, and the stakes are high. The ruling could set ground rules for competition in the modern economy, affecting companies and consumers alike for decades.

In some ways, the plaintiffs brought a very traditional antitrust suit. The Government says Microsoft repeatedly and illegally used its market power to block new competition represented by the rise of theInternet, especially software for browsing the World Wide Web. Microsoft, according to the Government, used exclusionary contracts and threats to defend its monopoly product -- the Windows operating system, the software that serves as the central nervous system of 90 percent of the personal computers sold today.

The software business is regarded as the forerunner of what has been called the new economy -- a fluid environment in which market leadership can be fleeting, but technology can also hasten the concentration of market power and the creation of monopolies. In short, new-economy theories can cut both ways in antitrust cases. There has been plenty of talk of network effects and winner-take-all markets from both sides in the Microsoft trial. The fact that the Microsoft case focuses on a fast-moving, technically complex industry complicates the legal judgment the court must make. It makes the toughest issues that courts have to deal with in antitrust cases -determining market power, evaluating the significance of conduct and designing remedies -- far more difficult, said William Kovacic, a professor at the George Washington University law school.

If the judge rules against Microsoft, the court will then focus on remedies. The Government says it is too early to discuss sanctions publicly. But among the proposals being studied are limiting the contract restraints Microsoft can place on PC makers, forcing Microsoft to publish the price it charges PC makers for Windows, and requiring broad disclosure of the interfaces in Windows used by software developers to write programs.

The thing to remember is that were engaged in a legal decathlon, and were still at an early stage, he explained. Unless the two sides reach a settlement, Judge Jacksons ruling, expected by the end of the year, will certainly be reviewed by a Federal appeals court and possibly by the Supreme Court as well. If it goes to the Supreme Court, the Microsoft case may well not be finally determined until 2002, legal experts say.

The Governments original complaint, filed in May 1998, charged that Microsoft was engaged in a series of anticompetitive activities. But it focused largely on the companys tactics in the browser market against the Netscape Communications Corporation, and specifically on Microsofts decision to fold its browser into its industry-standard Windows operating system. Microsoft, the Government contended, had illegally tied a second product to its monopoly product in a predatory effort to stifle competition and reduce consumer choice. But a month later, the Governments tying theory suffered a severe blow when a Federal appeals court ruled in a related case that Microsoft should be free to blend its browser into Windows as long as it can make a plausible claim of business efficiency or consumer benefit from doing so. Over the summer, the Justice Department and states continued investigating Microsofts dealings with other companies and came up with new evidence involving Intel, Apple Computer and others -- all of it, the Government said, fit into Microsofts"}

Over Microsofts objections, Judge Jackson permitted the new evidence. Suddenly, the focus of the case widened well beyond the browser wars to a broad, multifaceted scheme by Microsoft to protect its monopoly. With the retooling, the Government case also acquired a broad narrative theme that rose above the arcane details that are an inevitable part of a high-tech antitrust trial. Whatever the legal merits, the approach made the Governments case a much more compelling story to tell in court. So when an Intel executive testified to a credible and fairly terrifying threat from Microsoft or when an America Online executive testified that it had no choice but to adopt Microsofts browser in return for a coveted place on the Windows desktop, it all added detail to the Governments picture of Microsoft as an arm-twisting monopolist, stifling competition and"}

But I obviously dont believe that. What this case is about is protecting innovation to make a dynamic industry even more dynamic and innovative.

A lot of whats in the Governments case doesnt sound good, but it doesnt rise to the level of an antitrust violation, said Steven Holley, a Microsoft lawyer. In its defense, Microsoft has leaned on two key themes. The first, in essence, is: Our actions may have hurt some rival, but where is the harm to competition in general and to consumers? And the second theme, linked to the first, is: This is a vibrant industry. The harm, the Government and states reply, is that Microsofts actions would be fine if it were still a scrappy entrepreneurial upstart rather than an industry-dominating force. What Microsoft"}

What Microsoft did not recognize is that it had crossed the line to become a monopolist, so its behavior had to change, said Thomas Miller, the Iowa Attorney General. Microsoft disputes the monopolist label, but argues that the rules for dominant firms are not much different. We should be competing as hard as we can for the next customer because that behavior is good for consumers, Mr. Neukom of Microsoft said. In the end, clarifying the rules of legal behavior for powerful companies in the modern economy could well be the lasting legacy of the Microsoft case. This case can really determine the boundaries on the conduct of dominant firms for decades, observed Mr. Kovacic of George Washington University."}

Yes, there were problems, but now the constellation is working correctly and the demand is there; I can see it, and I can sense it. If Iridium cannot reverse course, however, and hammer out agreements with an array of debt holders in the coming weeks, its satellites may go on the auction block. Motorola, which designed and built the satellites, continues to support the venture. But if it fails, Motorola will face huge losses.

Motorola is preparing to build this constellation with the backing of Boeing, William H. Gates of Microsoft and Craig McCaw, the cellular telephone pioneer. Recent events are a far cry from the vision of Motorola engineers in 1985. With cellular service in its infancy, Motorola conceived a plan to use a network of satellites to deliver global telephone service. By 1994, Motorola raised $1.6 billion, the largest private placement in history, and created a company called Iridium. By the time Iridium came to market in November, though, cellular service had grown rapidly. Iridium said it wanted to serve the business traveler and began offering $3,000 handsets and satellite service at up to $7 a minute. Few signed up. (Prices have since been cut more than half.)

Niche markets also balked. Military officials, United Nations officers and media organizations shunned the service because of cost and reliability questions. United Nations officials said they were unwilling to take a chance on an expensive, unproved and apparently flawed service in the early days. CNN said the system malfunctioned in Bosnia. Iridium also lacked data capabilities, an increasingly important feature, particularly for the media. Iridium executives, however, say they have fixed many of the early glitches, and, the company says, customers are satisfied.

There was supposed to be a huge potential market, 42 million users by 2002. But early indications cast doubt on those numbers. There just arent customers out there, said Bryan Prohm, an analyst at Dataquest Inc. Now, Iridium -- while fully expecting to tap a broader market with smaller handsets next year -- says the market is not about millions of subscribers, it is about usage. The company is focusing on specialized users: the military, the news media and the maritime industry. Today, the dominant player in a specialized market is Inmarsat Inc., which has 150,000 subscribers.

The company, which says it has enough cash to operate for the next few months, has already defaulted on an $800 million bank loan, and angry debt holders are pressing for change. With new rivals coming to market, and class-action suits piling up against Iridium, Mr. Richardson is trying to negotiate with the banks and bondholders and win cost concessions from Motorola and the independent franchises. Iridium wants debt holders to swap debt for equity, and investors to plow in $500 million more, and then wait patiently for Iridium to grow into the market.

Cost cutting is critical, persuading franchises to overhaul their structure and Motorola to reduce a $50 million-a-month contract to operate the satellite service -- those payments to Motorola have been deferred. We are not paying that right now, and we have no intention of paying that, an Iridium official said. Maintaining and launching low-orbit satellites is expensive, but Iridium is being squeezed, analysts say. That contract is absurdly lucrative for Motorola, said Armand Musey, an analyst at Banc of America Securities. Iridium needs to cut that by half and then get between $500 million and $1 billion in new investments. Iridium may be running out of time.

But Leo Mondale, the chief financial officer of Iridium, just resigned, and Mr. Richardson said in a recent interview that he did not expect a restructuring agreement that soon. Smaller handsets will not be available until the new year, he said. Iridium is also facing new competitors. Globalstar is expected to begin its service later this month, hoping to capture a broader market by, in part, undercutting Iridium with smaller handsets and lower prices. The Iridium experience has no comparison to us, said Bernard L. Schwartz, chief executive of Globalstar. Youre talking about a three-legged race horse.

Even if Iridium restructures its debt and outmaneuvers its competitors, it still needs a huge influx of cash. Even 100,000 subscribers -- which some believe is unlikely in the next year -- at $1,000 of service apiece would mean revenues of just $100 million. Under the terms of Iridiums contract with Motorola and its interest payments ($250 million a year), Iridium needs more than $75 million a month to operate and market its products. There are also signs of tension among the 12 independent franchises, which operate the gateways that handle customer service, billing and distribution.

Carnegie Mellon Universitys graduate business school in Pittsburgh just introduced a masters of science program in electronic commerce that combines instruction in business and in computer science.

At Vanderbilt University in Nashville, 110 students, or a quarter of the M.B.A. candidates, have chosen E-commerce as either a concentration or specialty. Corporations are even more enthusiastic about E-commerce training than college and university administrators. Many companies think that employees with an intimate knowledge of modern computer technologies and E-commerce strategies might give them a competitive edge.

A few years ago, companies would say E-commerce experience on a students resume was nice to have. Now they are saying, must have. Wharton, which started its Electronic Commerce Forum three years ago as a research center for corporations, students and faculty members, has stepped up plans to introduce an E-commerce major for graduate students this fall. School officials said they were also considering offering a masters degree in electronic business. Changes in salaries reflect the growing demand. Five years ago, a new Wharton graduate with experience in E-commerce could expect a starting salary of $62,000, not including a bonus or stock options, Mr. Bonner said.

In most cases, the new programs have been a financial boon, bringing in tuition dollars and millions in grants to set up E-commerce research centers and faculty chairs. At Bentley College in Waltham, Mass., a new M.B.A. concentration, known as E-business, and a graduate-level certificate in electronic business have become part of a shift to technology in the entire business curriculum. School administrators said the change in focus had brought in $500,000 in additional tuition this fall along with at least $7 million in related grants and contributions for program support and development.

The E-commerce credential sends the signal that someone knows something about E-commerce and that theyve learned it in a focused and strategic way.

Because technology is advancing so quickly, the few E-commerce textbooks, articles and case studies available quickly become obsolete. There is no shortage of faculty members willing to teach E-commerce courses, administrators say. They generally come from closely allied fields, like computer science or information technology; recent Ph.D.s whose dissertations were in E-commerce; faculty gear heads, who have pursued consulting or research on behalf of Web-based businesses, and disciplinary migrants -- young and midcareer faculty members looking for fields in which they can become pioneers and make their reputations.

Cisco Systems, a leading Internet technology company, plans to brief analysts and reporters on Wednesday about a new approach to wireless communications that would be offered as soon as next year to provide both voice telephone service and Internet access. The technology is meant to be a nonmobile -- or fixed -- wireless alternative to the telephone industrys high-speed digital phone lines and cable television industrys Internet modems. Ciscos briefing will be the first detailed plans to follow an announcement last month by the company, Motorola and 10 other equipment makers and service providers who said they would create an industry-standard format for sending Internet data over a long-existing, little-used set of microwave frequencies. That frequency band, known as multichannel multipoint distribution services, or M.M.D.S., was set aside years ago for a form of wireless subscription television that was meant to compete with cable television but never really caught on. More recently, M.M.D.S. has been seen as a way for telecommunications giants like Sprint and MCI Worldcom to compete with the regional Bell operating companies to"}

More recently, M.M.D.S. has been seen as a way for telecommunications giants like Sprint and MCI Worldcom to compete with the regional Bell operating companies to provide direct connections to local telephone customers. Now Cisco and other equipment makers are trying to push M.M.D.S. into a full-blown voice and Internet-access technology. Use of the M.M.D.S. frequencies requires licenses from the Federal Communications Commission. But the commission has also set aside wireless frequencies in a band called the Unlicensed National Information Infrastructure. This second, unlicensed frequency band is meant to encourage experimental uses of the airwaves without the expense of buying or applying for licenses. Because Ciscos technology will also work with this unlicensed band, the company predicts that smaller Internet service providers and communications companies will be able to quickly enter and compete in the market for high-speed -- or broad band -- Internet access at relatively low cost. Fixed broad-band wireless access will change the world of telecommunications as profoundly as mobile telephony, said Dale R. Pfau, a financial analyst at CIBC World Markets in San Francisco.

Fixed broad-band wireless access will change the world of telecommunications as profoundly as mobile telephony, said Dale R. Pfau, a financial analyst at CIBC World Markets in San Francisco. Cisco executives predicted that consumers would be able to buy broad band wireless transmitter-receivers -known as transceivers -- for less than $500 by the end of 2000. At the heart of the Cisco-led alliances plans is a new wireless approach developed by a Silicon Valley designer, which deals with a thorny problem known as multipath interference that has long bedeviled communications engineers. At certain frequencies, wireless communications systems must contend with echoes from secondary signals that are reflected from buildings or hills and that arrive at the receiver slightly after the original signals. Television broadcasts, for example, have long been plagued by the phenomenon, commonly known as ghosting. The problem became an intriguing challenge to Greg Raleigh, a longtime Silicon Valley engineer, who in the early 1990s returned to Stanford University to study for an advanced degree.

Mr. Raleigh realized that with the vast amounts of computer power now available to perform signal processing it would be possible to transform multipath interference from a disadvantage into a benefit. Mr. Raleigh knew that, besides ghosting, there is typically a second drawback to fixed wireless communications: reliable transmissions require a clear line of sight between the transmitter and the receiver. That requirement poses special challenges to network designers attempting to reach tens of thousands of receivers in an urban area. But by using special encoding techniques, Mr. Raleigh reasoned, it might be possible to offer reliable two-way communications that would not require direct lines of site, but would instead use ghosting echoes as intentional signal paths rather than treating them as unwanted interference. With two of his Stanford classmates, Mr. Raleigh founded a company, Clarity Wireless, in an extra room in his home. There, they developed his theory into a technology called vector orthogonal frequency division multiplexing, or V.O.F.D.M. Cisco acquired Clarity Wireless in 1998"}

Cisco acquired Clarity Wireless in 1998 and recently decided to freely share its technology in an effort to quickly establish it as an industry standard. So far, besides Motorola, Cisco has secured commitments from Toshiba, Samsung, Texas Instruments and others to help develop components of the broad band wireless infrastructure. Ciscos is not the only approach in the M.M.D.S. broad-band data market, however. The companys wireless competitors will include Spike Technologies, ADC Telecommunications and Adaptive Broadband. But Ciscos prominence as an Internet technology vendor, along with the powerful alliance it has built, could give the company an inside edge, some analysts said. There is no real leader as yet, but Cisco has quite a strong story, said Tim Luke, a financial analyst at Lehman Brothers in New York.

Still, some telecommunications analysts point out that M.M.D.S. occupies a relatively limited frequency band. That means, they say, that communications carriers would need to set up a large number of transmitters in order to subdivide a metropolitan area into numerous cells to allow the same channels to be reused in different parts of the region. Cisco executives nevertheless contend that broad-band fixed wireless technology can be a cost-effective alternative to cable modems and digital phone lines in urban areas. As for rural areas, Cisco says that broadband wireless will hold dramatic advantages over traditional wired or fiber optic networks, which can be costly ways to provide service in sparsely settled places. Certainly the Cisco alliance, if its technology proves viable, will be in a position to compete for the many companies and consumers that seem to have developed an insatiable appetite for Internet data communications bandwidth.

Cisco intends to make these point-to-point customers the first target for its new V.O.F.D.M. technology. In fact, later this month the company will begin selling a high-speed wireless system that will permit companies to extend communications between buildings over relatively short distances.

In Europe, for example, there will be soon be an auction for radio spectrum at the 3.5 gigahertz frequencies. Meanwhile, in the United States, the Federal Communication Commission plans to auction spectrum for interactive data in the frequency band that until now has been used solely for ultrahigh frequency, or UHF, television."}

Their arrival, the companies supporting the Bluetooth technology say, will signal the beginning of the personal-area network. Bluetooth, which is the creation of a consortium of computer and communications companies -- Ericsson, I.B.M., Toshiba, Nokia and Intel -- was conceived two years ago as a way to eliminate the tangle of cables that plague device-happy computer users. It has since evolved from a way to reduce last-minute trips to Radio Shack for that missing nine-pin serial connector into a technology for a broad range of wireless applications. Bluetooth works by allowing high-speed communication among devices that are within 33 feet of one another. While some current mobile devices can communicate through infrared signals, those signals must have a clear, straight path from one device to the other. Bluetooth, in contrast, operates on a radio frequency, so its signals can penetrate walls and briefcases. That means an electronic organizer in your pocket could transmit a phone number to the cell phone in your briefcase and initiate a phone call -- all part"}

Or seconds after you snapped a photo from a ski lift, the digital camera could send the image to the cell phone in your pocket, which could then send the photo as an E-mail attachment to friends back home. Consider slightly more far-out scenarios, too: You arrive at the airport and buy a ticket simply by walking past a wireless terminal, which confirms your identity, issues an electronic ticket and bills your credit card.

Such seamless integration is Bluetooths goal as well, said Per-Erik Svensson, the Bluetooth marketing manager at Ericsson Mobile Communications. By this Christmas, a limited number of devices containing Bluetooth will be announced. Ericsson, for instance, will introduce a wireless cell phone headset. The headset will come with a small clip-on adapter for the phone with a Bluetooth chip in it. In the first half of 2000, PC cards with Bluetooth chips will be introduced; high-end cell phones and laptop computers will begin to appear in the second half of the year.

Bluetooths 2.4-gigahertz frequency (a gigahertz is a billion cycles per second), which also happens to be the frequency for microwaves and a new generation of cordless phones, does not mean that a Bluetooth device will start your oven or make your phone ring, said Brent Miller, a senior engineer who specializes in Bluetooth at International Business Machines. Bluetooth uses spread-spectrum technology, which means that the signals are sent over a wide range of frequencies and jump from one frequency to another. Its the frequency hopping, the hopping pattern and hopping speed that mitigates any interference problems, Mr. Miller said. Mr. Miller added that technical safeguards insured that a cluster of Bluetooth devices in, say, an airport lounge would not suddenly start talking to one another. Bluetooth wont be cheap. Initially, the add-on cost to manufacturers for incorporating Bluetooth into devices will be around $25. That will drop to about $5 as volumes increase. The cost to the consumer will, of course, be still higher. That added cost has given some manufacturers pause."}

Bluetooth is an interesting technology that everybody is taking a serious look at, said Mark Lowenstein, a senior vice president at the Yankee Group, a technology research company in Boston. But there has not yet been a solid commitment because the economics for deployment are not quite there yet. Still, more than 1,000 companies have signed on as Bluetooth adopters, which means that they are interested in incorporating the technology into their products and services. Once Bluetooth gains widespread acceptance, said John Patrick, vice president for Internet technology at I.B.M., you wont buy a product without it.

Bluetooth will allow people to be more inventive with the communications. You might be wearing a piece of jewelry, for instance, that was actually a wireless headset for your cell phone.

Some employees may leaf through plan summaries or peruse health-care provider directories to make their choices, but at an increasing number of companies, employees are doing things differently. These tasks are, or soon will be, completed electronically, from the desktop at the click of a mouse, and by the people getting the benefits, not by human resource departments. At the Oracle Corporation, the Boeing Company and Charles Schwab & Company, for example, workers surf internal corporate computer networks and Web sites set up by benefit providers to check their 401(k) account balances, switch health-care plans or update W-4 forms, all tasks that were once exclusively the job of human resources employees. Other companies, like the Marriott Corporation and Anheuser-Busch Companies, are using self-service call-in centers that link employees with benefits data; many of these systems present employees with a series of menus that enable them to make benefit choices.

Employers embrace the notion as a way to automate their human resources departments, cutting costs and increasing efficiency. Employees either like it or hate it. Some find it empowering to be able to see their files and change their choices. But others find it frustrating to be left to sort out the merits of an insurance plan on their own, trying to decipher the coverage limits described on an insurers Web site without the benefit of a human being to help explain them. That inherent tension leads some observers to question whether low-tech human assistance is better than high-tech self-help in the area of employee benefits, or in at least some parts of the benefits process.

I dont believe that one can completely replace the other. But one thing is certain: companies are quickly moving in that direction. Automating benefits through Web-based technology, called virtual H.R. (for human resources), is growing fast. Fifty percent of 466 companies surveyed now conduct at least some human resources transactions over the Web, nearly double the rate in 1997, according to a survey conducted last year by Watson Wyatt Worldwide, a consulting company in Bethesda, Md.

To the extent that it has a network and PCs, I think every company intends to move toward some type of self-service of its H.R. functions. Cost savings are driving the trend. Mr. McCormick cited a large pharmaceutical company that had moved parts of its benefits information on line through a local corporate network after figuring that it spent $16.40 each time it had to process an address change filed on paper. When the company multiplied that times its estimated 100,000 address changes a year, the cost savings become just so obvious, he said. Moving data on line can also give employees easier access to their benefits files so they do not have to wait for a paper statement.

The biggest gain is that employees can have access when they need to make a decision, said Lillian Petty, Schlumbergers benefits manager for North America. Theres a difference between pushing information to employees or letting them pull out what they want. The site, called the Schlumberger Automated Benefits Link, has received an average of 320 visits per day since it opened in May. Next up: full benefits enrollment on line this year. Our goal is to have paperless benefits administration, Ms. Petty said.

In that case, companies must take a different approach. At Schlumberger, for example, 52 self-service kiosks at its manufacturing centers give employees without computers access to the information that is available to other workers on line. A similar approach is being taken by Hard Rock Cafe International, a restaurant chain based in Orlando, Fla.

The concept of self-service benefits for employees is not new, but its acceptance has been slowed somewhat by a persistent image problem, Year 2000 compliance problems and by the need for companies to invest in Internet technology. We have more than enough technology to bring this about, said Joel Lapointe, vice president for management consulting at the Hunter Group in Baltimore. He said he coined the self-service phrase and developed the concept in the 1980s, and many of his peers in the industry agree with that. The roadblock continues to be a culture-acceptance problem, he added. On one hand, employees who are comfortable with technology enjoy having access to their own information and control over it, and they want more of it, Mr. Lapointe said. Employees know that companies have these sets of data about them, he said, but the source of the data is always the employee -- it all belongs to them.

One person who has studied management and employee benefits is Richard Hadden, president of Corporate Education Systems in Jacksonville, Fla., and co-author of Contented Cows Give Better Milk: The Plain Truth About Employee Relations and Your Bottom Line (Saltillo Press, 1998). Employees tend to see this newfound empowerment as either enablement or abandonment, Mr. Hadden said. If it enables them to do better things, thats good. If it leaves them feeling abandoned, that can be detrimental. If employees cant use or perceive they cant get what they need, which is so often the case with benefits issues, theyll be frustrated, and abandonment sets in.

Marriotts 100,000 employees can enroll in a health plan or change their choices by using touch-tone phones. But the companys system also lets workers bypass the voice-response system and reach a person at any time during the call, said Maureen Brookbank, vice president for benefits planning at Marriott. Its nice to know that a person is available if I need one, but its also nice not to have to go through them as a required part of getting the job done, said Laura Paugh, 44, vice president for investor relations at Marriott, who joined the company in 1980, when benefits enrollment was handled on paper by the human resources department.

Employees asked Marriott to simplify the language explaining the new system by substituting phrases like the people at Martie for Martie customer service representatives and push-button steps rather than touch-tone telephone instructions. Maintaining the privacy of the data is also a concern. At Schlumberger, for instance, an automatic password security check is done each time an employee logs on to retrieve personal information. If the check determines that the password can be easily broken, a message appears warning the employee that the code is weak and suggesting that a more secure one be devised. Experts acknowledge that the concept of self-service employee benefits is still in its early stages and that managers are still grappling with how to make employees feel at ease with the idea and master the technology.

The companies offering software packages that give workers access to their own records via Web browsers include the Edify Corporation in Santa Clara, Calif., Seeker Software in Oakland, Calif., and Foundation Technologies in Waltham, Mass. A survey made public last month by Benefits Access, a benefits administration company in Hartford that is a subsidiary of the Cigna Corporation of Philadelphia, found that 60 percent of 906 benefits managers of companies with 1,000 to 10,000 employees wished that they could provide workers with enough information to make and manage their own benefits decisions.

Its important for employers to be able to provide both low-tech and high-tech options for getting employees the information they need to make decisions.

There were only two nodes on what was then known as the Arpanet, the precursor to the Internet built by the Defense Departments Advanced Research Projects Agency. As the story has become enshrined in the folklore, a U.C.L.A. student named Charley Kline tapped out the letters l and o, which were dutifully echoed back by a computer at the Stanford Research Institute, a center about 300 miles northwest in what was not yet Silicon Valley.

There was no big ribbon-cutting a month later when a third node was installed at the University of California at Santa Barbara, or the following month, when the reach extended outside California to the University of Utah.

What was emerging would be barely recognizable today. There were no @ signs, no dot coms, no World Wide Web, nothing called E-mail. The main purpose was to let university-based researchers for the Defense Department agency share computer resources, allowing someone in, say, California to run a program on a machine in Massachusetts. Many system administrators were reluctant. Computer power was scarce. Why should they share it with strangers?

In an age when computers were still identified in the public mind with punch cards and spinning reels of tape, some of the early fomenters of the information age showed stunning prescience. As long ago as 1945, in The Atlantic Monthly, Dr. Vannevar Bush, the engineer, educator and government research adviser, came up with the basic idea of the personal computer, a device he called the memex -- a mechanical extension of human memory. Never mind that it was as big as a desk and that it stored all your documents, including encyclopedias and reference libraries, on super-fine-grained microfilm shuffled by nimble mechanical fingers and projected onto translucent screens. Though embodied in the clunky technologies of the time, the memex would work something like an associative memory -- or, less grandiosely, a relational database.

A user researching the history of the bow and arrow might start by calling up an encyclopedia article. When he found another relevant passage in a book, he would link the documents with a few keystrokes, encoding them with crude hyperlinks, and even add his own annotations. Thus he builds a trail of his interest through the maze of materials available to him, Bush wrote. To his credit, Bush also speculated that going beyond dry photography, the data might be stored as magnetized dots on metallic sheets using the technology that already existed for recording voices on spools of wire. And for entering data, he even envisioned the scanner, an outgrowth of the radio facsimile machines that already existed in his day. The big thing Bush missed was electronic networking. He imagined the researcher conferring with someone a few years later who wanted to incorporate the bow-and-arrow material into his own study on technology.

He had invented the World Wide Web with messengers on bicycles in place of high-speed digital T-3 lines. A decade and a half later, Dr. J. C. R. Licklider, one of the most visionary computer scientists of his day, took another leap with his predictions of a Galactic Network linking everyone to a universe of information. In a later paper titled The Computer as a Communication Device, he and Robert W. Taylor, who would go on to direct the Arpanet project, imagined nothing less than a labile network of networks, ever-changing in both content and configuration. What will go on inside? they asked.

Eventually, every informational transaction of sufficient consequence to warrant the cost. Each secretarys typewriter, each data-gathering instrument, each dictation machine, will feed into the network. There would be no need for letters, telegrams, telephone calls or even business trips. People would simply link their computers. Dictionaries, encyclopedias, investment advice, tax counseling, advanced scientific modeling programs -- all would be available within the Net. On-line communities would form with people selected more by commonality of interests and goals than by accidents of proximity. And, more ominously, the two researchers speculated, those denied the benefits of this intelligence amplification might be relegated to an information-deprived underclass. Both the bright and dark sides of todays Internet were anticipated years before the first message was sent. For all the grandiosity of the vision, the Internet developed haltingly. To make Lickliders Galactic Net a reality, scientists and engineers had to design a communications system that operated like none that had come before.

The obvious example to emulate might have been the telephone network, in which long-distance calls from one small town to another were routed like airline flights through one or more central hubs. But in the early 1960s, researchers began to realize that a computer network would be much less vulnerable to failure if it was more widely spread out -- less like the air travel system than like the network of back roads weaving together every municipality in the country. Each point is connected to its nearest neighbors by several redundant paths. If a connecting node between A and B fails, it is easy to find an alternative route. But there was an even more radical difference between the networks of old and the one that was about to take root. In an ordinary telephone system, two phones were linked by forming a temporary circuit, a dedicated physical channel through which the electrified voices flowed.

The telegraph used a different technology called message switching: each telegram was given an electronic address, then sent into the Net, where it would be relayed, node by node, to its destination. Paul Baran at the RAND Corporation and Donald Watts Davies at the British National Physical Laboratory independently saw the advantages of taking this store and forward model a step further. A message from one computer to another would be chopped up into many little packets, which would be sent swarming through the network to find their way. Some would take this route, some would take that. Each would carry a destination label along with instructions for where the packet fit inside the overall message. No matter in what sequence the pieces arrived, they could be reassembled. In this system, called packet switching, there would be no need to tie up a circuit for a single transmission. And since the messages were broken into smaller fragments, the flow would be smoother. Finally, if a packet got corrupted, one could just resend it and not the whole transmission. Around"}

Around the same time, Dr. Leonard Kleinrock, who would preside over the establishment of the first node at U.C.L.A., was using a mathematical tool called queuing theory to understand how data would flow in a packet-switched network. By 1966, with these and other basic ideas in place, Lawrence Roberts, recruited by ARPA from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, mapped out the plan. Two years after the first transmission, the number of host computers grew to 23. The @ symbol was invented in 1972, and a year later 75 percent of the Arpanet traffic was E-mail. It was starting to look like the Net. Before long, other organizations, like the National Science Foundation, wanted their own networks.

And that is just a fraction of the contributions. No one stands in relation to the Internet as Bell to the telephone or Morse to the telegraph. There was no single moment when it all came together. From the beginning, it was a continuous collaboration. And any attempt to recite the history in less than a book must be notable for its omissions. It was not until 1984, when the Net had grown to include 1,000 host computers, that the domain name system was established that lets Amazon.com be Amazon.com and not 208.216.182.15.

Writing in 1960, Licklider called this kind of technobiological mind meld man-computer symbiosis and ventured that bringing it together might take 15 years. The 15 may be 10 or 500, he added more realistically, but those years should be intellectually the most creative and exciting in the history of mankind.

The 328-page testimony by Richard L. Schmalensee of M.I.T. is a sweeping rebuttal to the Justice Departments two-and-a-half-month attempt to prove that Microsoft used its monopoly in personal computer operating system software to thwart competitive challenges posed by therise of the Internet. The Governments case, Mr. Schmalensee wrote in his direct testimony, amounts to speculation based on a morass of E-mails from Microsoft executives that at first glance may seem damaging, but are not. Forget the atmospherics, he tells the court, and focus on the outcome -- what he insists is a lack of measurable harm, current or future, to consumers from Microsofts business practices.

Proper economic inquiry into whether a company is engaged in anticompetitive conduct should end if it concludes that consumers have not been harmed by the conduct at issue and are not likely to be harmed in the future, Mr. Schmalensee wrote. High and rising product prices are typically the litmus test of whether a monopolist has the power to punish competitors and gouge consumers. The Governments evidence shows that Microsoft has increased the price it charges personal computer makers for its Windows operating system in recent years, even as the prices of other components of computer systems have declined. Still, the cost of Windows accounts for less than 5 percent of the price of a typical personal computer -- not really evidence of the kind of price-gouging normally associated with a monopolist, as some economists have noted. But the Governments case is focused as much on the future as on the recent past. If Microsoft is allowed to continue to thwart competition, the Justice Department says, consumers will surely suffer from less product choice, less innovation and higher prices in the long run.

The case will be decided by Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson in this nonjury trial based on his determination of which side the preponderance of the evidence favors. Microsofts objective is to convince the court that there are enough flaws in the Governments case that the balance should tip toward the company. In his testimony, Mr. Schmalensee describes the suit by the Justice Department and 19 states as fundamentally inconsistent. The Government asserts, he notes, that Microsoft has an enduring monopoly because its Windows operating system controls the basic operations on more than 90 percent of personal computers sold, and that barriers to entry in that market are high. On the other hand, he adds, the Government says that Microsoft invested hundreds of millions of dollars because it was scared of losing its dominance to an upstart maker of Internet browser software, the Netscape Communications Corporation.

What is striking about the late-night E-mails and the almost frantic concern over competitive threats is that they show that Microsoft itself was extremely insecure about its leadership in operating systems, Mr. Schmalensee said. David Boies, the Justice Departments lead trial lawyer, replies that Microsoft was indeed deeply worried and did work to improve its software, but it also had its thumb on the scale. The Government has made several allegations against Microsoft, but a central one is that the company used its market power to prod personal computer makers, Internet service suppliers and Internet programmers to enter into exclusionary contracts that limited the distribution and promotion of Netscapes rival browsing software. The Microsoft defense, again, is that the outcome in the marketplace shows that Netscape could and did widely distribute many millions of copies of its browser despite Microsofts purportedly anticompetitive business practices.

In the last two years, Mr. Schmalensee notes, Netscape has gained an additional 14 million users of its browsing software. But to gain these 14 million users, the Government replies, Netscape distributed about 200 million copies of its browsing software at considerable extra cost, even as Microsoft gave away its browser for free and bundled it with Windows. Such Microsoft tactics, the Justice Department asserts, are part of a pattern of predatory practices intended to stifle competition. Mr. Schmalensee counters that Microsofts contracts requiring personal computer makers to ship the companys browser with Windows offer more choices to consumers and are therefore pro-competitive. His testimony is an advocates brief, so Mr. Schmalensee, like the 12 prosecution witnesses, seems to interpret the evidence to suit his argument. For example, when the experience of America Online Inc. supports the Justice Department, Mr. Schmalensee refers to the leading on-line services company as Microsofts fickle partner and bitter rival.

America Online, Mr. Schmalensee writes, skillfully exploited the many distribution channels open to it (or any other competitor) to beat MSN. Far from being the most valuable real estate in cyberspace, Mr. Schmalensee declares, the Windows desktop is not an even particularly important channel of distribution -- a view not held by Microsoft executives, according to several internal E-mail messages in evidence.

But Gettysburg College (www.gettysburg.edu), a private liberal arts college with 2,200 students in Gettysburg, Pa., has taken the electronic campus a step further by allowing students and parents access to an interactive Web-based system that tracks and links many aspects of college life. The system, called the College Navigation Project, was started about a year ago as a way to link students to one another and to a wide array of campus information, like financial records, grades and course descriptions. A version for parents was added at the end of October. Students can customize the College Navigation Project to meet their own needs. Don Redman, a Web programmer and analyst with the project, compares the system to a giant puzzle builder. Students can feed the system different bits of information about themselves, their studies, career goals or personal interests to create a student profile, he said.

Gettysburg programmers say that customization sets the College Navigation Project apart from Web systems at other colleges. Other schools are publishing information on the Net, Mr. Redman said, but as far as we know, were about the only ones taking it to the next step by making it personally useful. For example, students who need rides out of town for the weekend can tell the system where they want to go, when they want to leave and how close they need to get to their destinations.

Its really a snapshot in time, Mr. Redman said. The College Navigation Project was designed and built in the past three years at a cost of about $250,000 and is used regularly by 78 percent of enrolled students, Mr. Martys estimated. Ninety percent of the students have active system accounts, he said. Many other colleges and universities are taking steps to use Internet technology to link systems, students and former students.

Federal law protects the privacy of student education records, including many of those that can be viewed through the College Navigation Project.

The idea of parents peering into their childrens lives on campus also raises some interesting questions, Gettysburg officials and others concede.

The executives said a deal could be announced within a week but cautioned that the negotiations could still fall apart. One person close to the talks said there was an 85 percent chance that the two companies would complete a deal. Another person close to the negotiations estimated that chance at 90 percent. Spokesmen at Nortel, which is based in the Toronto suburb of Brampton, Ontario, and Qtera, which is based in Boca Raton, Fla., declined to comment. Qtera, which is underwritten by venture capitalists, is among a group of young, little-known companies that are developing the next generation of optical communications technology. Along with deregulation and therise of the Internet, the quick pace of optical development has been a main factor in the communications revolution, allowing glass fibers thinner than a human hair to carry billions of bits of digital information each second.

Big communications equipment companies like Nortel and Lucent Technologies, the former equipment unit of AT&T, spend billions of dollars each year on research and development. But because there are so many technologies to pursue, the big players often find themselves acquiring start-up companies that have focused on niche areas that end up becoming important. Qtera is developing technology that allows fiber optic lines to carry signals farther than they usually do now without regeneration. Generally, optic signals that are carrying billions of bits a second must now be regenerated every 250 to 375 miles, analysts said. When the optical signals are regenerated, they are usually converted into electrical signals, then amplified and reconverted into pulses of light. The need for such regeneration adds cost and complexity to the construction and operation of continent-spanning fiber optic networks. Such networks are being built worldwide. Along with other companies like the Corvis Corporation, Qtera is developing a system meant to allow signals to travel as far as 2,000 miles without"}

Qtera has the right solution to carry very high bandwidth traffic over very long distances cost effectively, more cost effectively than just about anything on the market today. The only other company that has a comparable solution is Corvis. Both Qtera and Corvis, which is based in Columbia, Md., have tested their systems with Qwest Communications International Inc., the upstart long-distance communications carrier that has agreed to acquire U S West Inc., the regional Bell company.

A cookie labels the users computer for identification if it later connects to the same site; the cookie does not collect data about the users activity on the Internet. CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES WEDNESDAY JUNE 09, 1999 An emerging category of World Wide Web software that blocks advertising is challenging the Web industry and rankling the nerves of some Internet executives. Known by such names as At Guard, Internet Junkbuster Proxy, Intermute and Web Washer, these programs work by blocking ads before they appear on the users screen.

Invariably, industry officials draw a comparison to television: If users want free Web content they, like network television viewers, will need to put up with the advertising that pays for it. If ad blocking is freely available how will everyones needs be met? said Scott Mathias, managing editor at ITVWorld.com, a producer of on-line programming.

Real Networks primary customers, which operate Web sites that employ its software for transmitting audio and video material, complained that Real Networks had no business promoting a product like At Guard that could threaten their advertising revenue. Certainly a lot of money is at stake. Last year, advertisers spent nearly $2 billion to reach on-line audiences. Most of that spending was for so-called banner advertisements -- ads, often flashing or otherwise animated, that appear at various spots on Web pages and beckon users to click for further information. By next year, barring a mass adoption of ad-blocking software, the Internet research firm Jupiter Communications expects banner ads to represent $4.4 billion a year in Web advertising revenue.

Siemens A.G., the German electronics giant that produces Web Washer, estimates that roughly a million people have begun using the program since it was released in December. And Internet Mute Inc., the Cambridge, Mass., company that makes Intermute, has had rising sales in the same period. The numbers may still be small, compared with the estimated 67 million Web surfers in the United States.

Advertisers nonetheless contend that ad banners help them build brand awareness, even when consumers do not actually click on them. But Web site operators complain that when an ad is blocked it is not downloaded from the advertising server computer, which means they do not get paid for serving an ad to that visitor to the site. Clamoring for the attention of these increasingly jaded consumers, advertisers are adding more graphics and sound to their Web ads -- which, in turn, means that Web surfers end up waiting longer and longer for the ad-supported pages to appear on their screens.

But he said that Siemens was standing firm. The company, which hopes to become a leader in Internet technology, wants to curb the surfeit of information on the network and encourage the industry to develop forms of advertising that are better tailored to the medium. Like many ad blockers, the Siemens program is free, distributed through the companys own site and others. We believe that this paradigm shift -- in a significant part initiated by Web Washer -- is widely recognized and irreversible, Dr. Joepen said.

In fact, Mr. Arruda feels so strongly that ad blocking is a form of thievery that his company has written software code that prevents anyone using an ad blocker from even logging onto the companys site.

If a commercial comes on while you are watching television, she points out, you are free to change channels. And in television, Ms. Marshall said, there are industry standards governing the length and loudness of commercials. By comparison, the Web is a free-for-all, and advertisers are taking full advantage of new technology to make ads as attention-grabbing as possible. Yahoo, America Online and many other Web sites have apparently gotten the message, and have imposed a memory size limit on banner advertisements. Still, ad-blocking advocates argue, not all Web sites make an effort to keep ad sizes down, and users should be given a choice whether they want to endure the performance problems that huge ads create. Users want more control over their experience, Ms. Marshall said. If Web sites kept ad sizes down to a reasonable level, that would be a"}

For people who surf the Web from work, where a user is more likely to have high-speed access, banner ads have far less effect on Web performance. But even though cable modems and other fast links are becoming available to home users, most households still connect to the network through relatively pokey dial-up modems connected to telephone lines. And even if network speed were not a factor, privacy might be. Besides blocking advertisements, most of these programs also prevent the installation of cookies -- downloaded files that install themselves on the hard drive of Web users computers and invisibly collect data about their Web activities, such as which sites they visit and which pages they look at.

But Mr. Catlett of Junkbusters, and many analysts, say that most people simply do not want to bother with installing the software.

While Charles Schwab & Company and E*Trade have established themselves as the most recognizable on-line names, the fastest-growing firms are Waterhouse Securities, a discount broker turned on-line provider that does relatively little advertising, and Datek Online, a broker that caters to what some in the business call hyperactive traders. And that, analysts say, is another hint that when it comes to the retail market -- that is, smaller investors -- the shape of things to come may be trickling up from below. All the big Wall Street firms are looking at how these companies are shaping on-line trading, said Bernard L.

For Mr. Robertson, who is widely regarded as one of the best investment managers of his time, the humbling comedown is perhaps the most dramatic reversal of recent memory in the money management business -- not only because Tiger has lagged severely behind the broad stock market over the last 15 months, but also because its previous record was so dazzling. The loss of capital -- from both investor withdrawals and investments -- has made Mr. Robertson, a 67-year-old billionaire who in recent years has started spreading some of his wealth to philanthropies like Lincoln Center, intent on righting the firm before he retires.

Just when you thought that Mr. Armstrong, AT&Ts chairman of 18 months, could not possibly bite off another big deal, he does just that, and the masses in the communications industry are sent fleeing to find ways to cope. Last weeks casualty may have been the Comcast Corporation, the big cable television operator. Just when it looked as if AT&T had settled down to manage its own $31.8 billion acquisition of Tele-Communications Inc., the No. 2 cable carrier, Mr. Armstrong swam into the middle of Comcasts pending $53 billion deal for the Mediaone Group and roiled the waters with an unsolicited bid for AT&T to buy Mediaone for $58 billion. Comcast may still win the batlle, but many analysts say that AT&T, with its superior financial power, will likely beat Comcast and win Mediaone -- if regulators allow it.

The main question for AT&T now is whether its appetite has exceeded its ability to integrate its businesses into the lean yet powerful communications machine that Mr. Armstrong wants AT&T to become. As Mr. Armstrong propels AT&T headlong into the future he has envisioned, the company faces mounting challenges -- not only of management and strategy, but also of regulation and technology. Perhaps the most daunting management challenge for AT&T is the sheer breadth of Mr. Armstrongs strategic ambition. After John Zeglis, AT&Ts president, was conspicuously absent during the companys Mediaone announcement last Thursday, several analysts wondered where he was. It turned out he was in Japan.

AT&T and British Telecommunications will also fold into Japan Telecom two of their existing Japanese ventures, with combined annual revenue of just more than $200 million. The announcements near simultaneity with the Mediaone bid was either impressive or unnerving, because it demonstrated Mr. Armstrongs comfort with juggling multiple deals. In fact, the Japan Telecom and Mediaone deals are part of the same strategy, Mr. Zeglis said over the weekend. We want to go end-to-end delivering services for our customers on our own architecture. Despite AT&Ts common goal of controlling its own architecture, or electronic infrastructure, there is a big difference between these two deals.

And it is the companys hunger for residential customers that best explains AT&Ts seeming feeding frenzy. It is clear by now that AT&T is terrified of the prospect of at least one of the local Bell phone companies, probably Bell Atlantic, being poised to win regulatory approval to enter AT&Ts core long-distance business this year. By way of a harbinger, AT&T is well aware of what happened in Connecticut after the Southern New England Telecommunications Corporation, which did not need special approval, began offering long-distance service to Southern New Englands local phone customers. Large numbers of Connecticut customers dropped long-distance service from AT&T, among others, to take a single package of local and long distance from S.N.E.T. AT&Ts strategic planners hate to contemplate the millions of local phone customers who might drop AT&T phone service once Bell Atlantic is freed to offer long-distance service to customers along the Eastern Seaboard, or even just in New York.

It is a much bigger worry for AT&T than for its principal long-distance rivals, MCI Worldcom and Sprint, because AT&T derives a much higher proportion of its long-distance revenue from residential consumers than do MCI and Sprint. Mr. Armstrong has decided that the solution is to counterattack the Bells by taking the war to a new front -- off the conventional local telephone network and onto cable TV systems. Through those cable lines, AT&T intends to offer local and long-distance calling, as well as Internet service. It will probably take a few years to determine whether that strategy is visionary or foolhardy. AT&T would like to offer its cable-based services using a variant of Internet technology. Because this is a largely experimental approach, it poses large technical challenges.

AT&T is well practiced in telephone-network technology, but linking so much of its future to cable television networks means the company needs to rely on experts from outside the AT&T tradition. Foremost among them is Leo Hindery, the former No. 2 executive at TCI who now runs AT&Ts cable operation -- but who is still largely unfamiliar with AT&T and its culture in offering telephone service. The same could be said for the highly respected Amos B. Hostetter, Mediaones largest shareholder, who AT&T has said will become chairman of its cable and Internet unit if its Mediaone bid succeeds.

Under Federal Communications Commission ownership rules, no single entity can control cable systems that together are available to more than 35 percent of the nations households. But those rules have been suspended pending a review by the F.C.C. And there are financial imponderables. AT&T -- with backing from Chase Manhattan Bank and Goldman, Sachs & Company -- seems set to raise $30 billion in cash to support its Mediaone bid.

The stakes for Mr. Armstrong, not to mention AT&T, are high. And they keep escalating. If the cable strategy works well, he will become known as one of the most visionary and dynamic executives of his day. If it does not, business history might one day recall him as a former I.B.M. executive who was passed over for the top job at that company and who, later, when given the chance to run AT&T, tried to prove too much. For now, at least, dynamic seems to be winning. And Mr. Armstrong, presumably, is looking for his next Jaws sequel."}

Such connections would bypass communications systems and Web services developed by Excite@Home, an Internet-over-cable company that is backed by many big cable television players -- including AT&T. All along this battlefront, AT&T has taken an adamant stance: Because it is investing billions of dollars to upgrade its cable networks to carry Internet data, AT&T has argued that it should have exclusive right to determine how those systems are used for Internet access.

At AT&T, it was only after Mr. Armstrong created management stability by taking over as chairman in 1997 that the company seemed to develop a coherent long-term plan, one meant to reassert its primacy in the communications business, especially with residential consumers.

As a counter force, AT&T wants to use its cable lines to deliver local phone service, as well as long-distance, digital TV and high-speed Internet access. That is where America Online comes in. Its 18 million customers give the company a far bigger market share than any other Internet provider and a clientele that is presumably in a better position to appreciate the benefits of a high-speed service than people who have not yet ventured on line. To AT&T, therefore, a deal with America Online might seem a good way to increase penetration of cable modem service.

In any case, from America Onlines perspective, it may make sense to cut a deal with AT&T, rather than to continue waging a political war that might drive AT&T into a wholehearted commitment to the full-service concept of Excite@Home.

For America Online to work cooperatively with AT&T while it is still under obligation to Excite@Home, all parties would probably have to accept less money from each customer.

It would be foolish for AT&T to totally turn its back on the national Internet network that At Home developed and to forswear use of At Homes technology for managing local networks.

On the surface, each company has very different ideas about what should be done. But, the companies may settle their differences and come up with a compromise suitable to both. AT&Ts VIEW America Online wants to plug into AT&Ts cable systems directly, without having to use the routing and management services provided by Excite@Home.

POSSIBLE COMPROMISE In the end, AT&T may not cave in to America Onlines demand for direct access to cable customers. But, America Onlines unmatched brand power on the Internet, and its universe of 18 million subscribers, may entice AT&T to offer America Online the right to serve as the portal through which cable customers connect to the Internet, instead of the Excite@Home portal.

The structure is the new home of Amazon.com, the ever-expanding Internet retailer that most other Internet retailers worship and strive to emulate. The Amazon creed is to break the budget on acquiring new customers -on the theory that big profits will come later, once the companys name is established and the Webs lower operating costs make it impossible for brick-and-mortar competitors to keep up. But drive another 20 minutes down the highway from this shrine to E-commerce, and you come to an undistinguished, low-lying office park in the industrial suburb of Kent. Here, an E-business with a very different philosophy is blossoming: rei.com, the Internet division of the outdoor gear and apparel retailer Recreational Equipment Inc. Though rei.com is small compared with Amazon.com -- only $50 million in annual sales versus $610 million -- it is similiarly dominating its market.

One of every $100 spent on outdoor gear this year will pass through rei.com. Like Amazons management, the people who run rei.com are proud of their results and have big plans for the future. But unlike Amazon, rei.com turns a profit. Recreational Equipment Inc., generally known as REI, also operates real-world retail stores, giving the outdoors company a first-hand basis for comparing the on-line with the old-line business models. And REIs experiences run counter to the main assumptions that have grown up around E-commerce and have contributed to the stratospheric stock prices of Web retailers like Amazon. Contrary to the myths, rei.com says: Running brick-and-mortar stores has turned out to be not a liability but a huge advantage. The operating costs of the Web site have consistently gone up -- not down. And whatever the barriers that Internet technology may pose to potential rivals, that advantage has been largely offset by the start-ups own, daunting technical challenges.

As most of the pure plays have shown, there is not a lot of profit in it, and I dont see the economics changing in the foreseeable future. Which is not to say that REI doesnt view E-commerce as an important part of the companys future. Nor does it mean that industry experts see REI as a bumbler. They are a great company, said Kate Delhagen, a senior E-commerce analyst with Forrester Research. I use them all the time as my poster child for success. As a behind-the-screens look at REIs Web operation makes clear, the point is simply that on-line retailing is one tough business. That is true even for an offbeat company like REI, whose quirks have offered serendipitous advantages.

REI, which was founded in 1938, is a cooperative, which means that at the end of each year, 85 percent of its profits are divided among 1.5 million customers who have paid an annual membership fee. REI was receptive early on to the Internet, going on line in September 1996, at a time when most traditional retailers were still taking a wait-and-see stance. REI also benefited from the demographics of its active, outward-bound customer/members -- a whopping 83 percent of whom have Internet access at home or at work, almost double the national average. Finally, having a catalogue operation that already brought it more than 5 percent of the company revenue by 1996 gave the retailer an important head start in warehousing and distribution. Yet even with these advantages, the effort to build rei.com into a viable business has been far from a cakewalk for the executive in charge: Matt Hyde, a sinewy 36-year-old mountain climber.

Mr. Hyde, who is now vice president for on-line sales, has been with the company since he graduated from Oregon State with a degree in geology but quit twice, once in his mid-20s to start a business that ran climbing trips in exotic locales like Afghanistan and Chile. His easygoing manner softens but does not mask his intense, 16-hour-day personality. And he compares building a Web site to ascending an oxygen-less 23,000-foot peak: You do it because its a challenge, not because its fun. It is Mr. Hyde who is the list keeper for the most common Internet business myths, and his favorite is the idea that a physical store is more expensive to run than a Web store. Amazons founder, Jeffrey P. Bezos, has been known to brag that he employs but a third of the staff of his biggest competitor, Barnes & Noble, to achieve a proportional amount of book sales.

And soon, he says, the balance will tilt toward the Web site, as the cost of the sites payroll rises steadily. Competition for information-technology expertise is so fierce that every three or four months Mr. Hyde reviews published studies on salaries in the industry and, if he is lagging, automatically offers raises to his technical team. The industry average for a skilled technical position, like programmer or systems manager, is about $80,000 a year.

Rei.com, in contrast, spent $500,000 for its original opening, including all machinery and programming. But the rei.com upgrades have never ceased -- and probably never will, according to Rod Ketchum, the operations senior Web adviser. As the person in charge of Web karma, as he puts it, Mr. Ketchum is the one who is called whenever the system has glitches, however small. Usually at 3 A.M., he said genially. Mr. Ketchum said he had ordered four upgrades in the last two months. The most recent was a $500,000 overhaul by I.B.M. to enable the system to use its processing power more efficiently.

Mr. Hyde estimates that he has spent in excess of $15 million since 1996 on upgrades and remodeling. But Mr. Hyde, who previously managed REIs adventure travel program and its direct-mail operation, had expected the technology costs. Some other expenses have come as a surprise. In setting up the operation, Mr. Hyde thought he could piggyback off the photographic, distribution and warehousing capacities of the companys catalogue operation. But for displays in its catalogue, for example, REI shoots film, and rei.com managers quickly realized that digital images worked better for the Web.

Apparel styles change twice a year; hard goods like tents, sleeping bags and bicycles are redesigned by their manufacturers annually. Which explains, in other words, why the best-known Internet merchants sell mainly books and compact disks. Such items are standardized and do not require the same merchandizing finesse as, say, REIs Gramicci Serpentine knit cotton shirt or the Dagger Delta Expedition Kayak. As Bill Curry, an Amazon spokesman, said, his company either scans in the covers or gets the images from the publisher. Other reasons help explain why even REIs extensive catalogue distribution and warehouse system have not translated fluently into Web commerce. The big difference between a catalogue customer and an Internet customer is that the Internet customer expects the order faster, said Clark Koch, the manager in charge of order fulfillment."}

They are planning a new just in time system that would allow them to process orders within an hour of placement. But unlike booksellers, which work mostly with a handful of distributors accustomed to shipping small quantities of their products at light speed, REI has more than 1,000 vendors.

The parent company, which does $587 million in sales annually, has been supportive enough that the start-up has had to make few sacrifices. Still, some belt-tightening has been unavoidable. Among the cuts that caused some soul-searching was a recent decision to give vendors the job of writing the detailed product descriptions that appear next to the photos on the Web.

There is a very synergistic role between on-line and retail, he said. It is just a matter of leveraging your advantages. Marketing, as expected, is a big advantage. Surveys show that most REI Web customers already knew the retailers name before they logged on. Fears of potential disadvantages like cannibalization -- that is, that the Web operation would take customers from REI stores -- have not been realized. True, REI estimates that 50 percent of the people shopping with them on line are repeat customers. But the company has also found that customers who are multichannel shoppers -- using stores and the Web, say --spend on average $150 more a visit than single-channel shoppers.

But that is simply prelude to, not in place of, opening a Japanese store, as REI plans to do in Tokyo next April. Mr. Hyde explained that having a real store in Japan would benefit his entire Web operation, because obstacles like tariffs, exchange rates and customs regulations can make it costly and cumbersome to ship overseas. He predicts that within a year rei.com will sell more than any one of the companys stores. But he says he still cannot imagine a time when rei.com will be a cash mother lode.

Network executives have had their hands full placing all the ads in time slots that are not back to back. The idea of exclusivity -- sole sponsor of the pre-game show, for example -- has gone the way of full stock trading commissions. Even the New York Stock Exchange sees sports and Wall Street as natural allies. The exchange, which is preparing to become a public company itself in the near future, has hired a bevy of high-price sports talent, including Sammy Sosa, the Chicago Cubs home-run slugger, to promote the theme that the Big Board is at the center of the sports universe.

Its loyal fans are more ethnically diverse, more male and less likely to have a fat investment portfolio than those of other leading sports, advertisers say. Moreover, the stock market is not as red hot as it was early in the year, and on-line brokerage accounts are not growing as fast. So why the rush? E*Trade, one of the first Internet brokerage firms, made a splash by buying expensive air time on the World Series last year. Its account growth soared not long after.

FISHER", "chunk": "SAN FRANCISCO, May 23 -- Investors, analysts and customers of the Oracle Corporation have grown accustomed to hearing its executives make caustic remarks about competitors. Usually, they aim their sharpest invective at giants like the Microsoft Corporation and I.B.M. or top executives at those companies. But lately, Lawrence J. Ellison, chairman and chief executive of Oracle, and his lieutenants have directed their scorn at two little-known neighbors in Silicon Valley: Siebel Systems Inc. and Ariba Inc. Why has Oracle, the No. 2 software company in the world behind Microsoft, directed shots at two tiny rivals? In a word, growth. In its third quarter, Oracle reported that sales of its applications, which big companies use to manage accounting, personnel and manufacturing processes, grew 5 percent, down from 19 percent in the second quarter. Sales of Oracle data base software, which keeps track of all of an enterprises transactions like sales, inventory levels and records, grew 10 percent, down from 26 percent in the second quarter. In the same period, Siebel, which has seized the lead in software for managing sales staff and service operations, had an 81 percent surge in revenue. At Ariba, a leader in"}

At Ariba, a leader in procurement software, which big companies use in purchases of goods and services, sales were up more than 10 times, albeit from a relatively small base. Oracle shares closed on Friday at $25.75, up 43.75 cents for the day, but off by more than one-third from their 52-week high. Analysts say that although Oracle appears well positioned for the long term -- with strong Internet technology, and with the recently distracted Mr. Ellison apparently re-engaged in daily operations -- the company is under substantial short-term pressure. Microsofts SQL Server continues to eat away at the low end of the market for Oracles core data base program, Oracle 8i, which alone contributes more than 70 percent of company revenue.

Executives close to Mr. Lane have said that he is at the top of a short list of candidates to succeed Lewis E. Platt as chairman and chief executive of the Hewlett-Packard Company after it spins off its test and measurement business later this year. Mr. Lane joined Oracle in 1991 from the consulting firm Booz, Allen & Hamilton, where he had headed the information technology consulting group. Insiders say that executive meetings previously run by Mr. Lane are now run by Mr. Ellison or by Gary L. Bloom, an executive vice president, who many believe is being groomed for the presidents job.

Soft-spoken and direct, Mr. Lane has been viewed as the perfect balance to Mr. Ellison. Mr. Lane was not available for comment, and other Oracle officials declined to discuss his potential departure. Just before gathering at Oracle headquarters earlier this month, several analysts cut their earnings estimates for the companys fourth quarter, which ends on May 31. They said after the meeting that they had heard nothing to change their views. Oracle completely dodged questions regarding the current quarter and probably successfully refocused people on the future, said William Epifanio of J. P. Morgan. Theyre very cautious. They are very uncertain about whats going to happen in the quarter. At recent analysts meetings and user group conferences, Mr. Ellison has said that his company will kill Siebel and Ariba the way it killed Sybase, Informix and Peoplesoft, each of which has indeed suffered from a combination of Oracles aggressive competition and self-inflicted wounds.

A new ad campaign that takes aim at Siebel is reminiscent of a 1980s ad that portrayed an aerial dogfight in which Oracle sent the Ashton-Tate Corporation, maker of dBase, flaming to the ground. Analysts say that with sales of Oracles traditional back-office applications, like those for accounting and personnel slowing, the move to front-office programs, like sales-force automation, is logical. Along those lines, SAP of Germany, the leading producer of back-office software, with application sales several times Oracles, has announced a new suite of front-office programs. But Oracle has been rolling out a mixture of homegrown and acquired front-office products since 1995 with little to show for it. And early evaluations of Oracles latest customer-relationship-management software, released this month, say it does not measure up to competitors products. Oracle customers with long memories may remember other category-killer announcements that did not pan out, like Oracle Documents, which was positioned as a Lotus Notes killer, and Oracle Power Objects,"}

Mr. Ellison said Oracles offerings differed from those of Siebel and other vendors by their breadth and integration and by their use of Internet technology. Oracle offers a suite of programs covering everything from acquiring customers to managing service calls, and they can all be operated from a simple Web browser, he said. We are the only ones in the world with a complete C.R.M. suite, Mr. Ellison said of customer-relationship-management software. Just as SAP unified the back office with a suite of products, we will integrate the front office, beat Siebel tactically and beat SAP strategically.

Wendy Close, who wrote the report for a group of 19 analysts, said Oracle was unwilling or unable to furnish customers to interview who were using the programs in production. Just because you spend some marketing dollars, and have your C.E.O. talk about it, doesnt mean you have a decent product or reference-able customers, Ms. Close said. Mr. Ellison brushed off the reports conclusions. The good news is our front-office stuff is new, all Internet-based; the bad news is its new, he said.

The fact of the matter is, outside of the data base business and the consulting business, you will not find anything Oracle has succeeded in. Mr. Siebel, a former Oracle executive who founded his company in 1990, said Mr. Ellisons attacks had prompted him to start bundling Siebels applications with I.B.M.s DB2 data base rather than with Oracle 8i, and he predicted other companies would follow suit. Theyre alienating all their old partners, he said. If so, Oracles push into applications would seem to benefit I.B.M., which has been heavily marketing its DB2 data base as a foundation for electronic commerce. Companies like Charles Schwab, Wal-Mart Stores and Macys run their Web-based businesses on DB2. The relationships we have with Siebel, SAP, Peoplesoft and Baan are very important to us, said Janet Perna, general manager of data management for I.B.M.s software group.

But John Ramacciotti, vice president for procurement at Cypress Semiconductor, said he chose Aribas software after evaluating Oracles offering, primarily for its ease of use. Cypress uses Oracles data base, financial-accounting program and other back-office applications. The biggest issue with Oracle was the huge amount of training needed to get anybody, even my procurement experts, up to speed, he said. Their Web-based solution was just a semi-friendly face on the same old bill of goods. It was so difficult to use that even the people doing the demo couldnt use it effectively.

Analysts say Oracle 8i remains an excellent data base management program that has been thoroughly updated to work over the Internet, and indeed it is the engine behind such high-traffic sites as Amazon.com and Dell.com. By owning the data base platform upon which its front-office applications run, Oracle has an advantage. Oracle, to win, does not really need to sell front-office applications, said Curt A. Monash, president of Monash Information Services of Cambridge, Mass. Oracle needs a big wave of automation of front-office functions running on the Oracle data base. Bobby Cameron of Forrester Research says Oracle has all the technical tools needed to make great applications: the data base, which does all the heavy lifting of transaction processing and record-keeping; network computing, which shifts computing tasks from the desktop to central servers, a must for Web-based programs; support for the Java programming language that makes browser-based applications"}

All of that is excellent, Mr. Cameron said. The question is whether the people creating the applications will use all of that. As companies shift their businesses to the Internet, he said, there is a bigger opening for a new approach than for incremental improvements.

The device, which Cisco calls a virtual switch controller, is based on Internet technology and is meant to augment or replace existing communications switches made by companies including Northern Telecom Ltd. of Canada and Ericsson A.B. of Sweden. But it is Lucent Technologies Inc., invigorated by its recent $20 billion deal to acquire Ascend Communications Inc., that Cisco has identified as its main competition. And it is Lucent, North Americas No. 1 maker of traditional switching gear, that is the main target of Ciscos new product; Cisco said yesterday that the virtual switch controller would give it inroads into an $8 billion chunk of Lucents business.

Much of the business of companies like Lucent and Northern Telecom is based on equipment that uses circuit switch technology, which gives each voice conversation its own communications lane. Some communications experts believe that circuit-switch technology will eventually be replaced by systems that can perform more efficiently by breaking down communications into small pieces. Those pieces, known as packets, can then share a common communications pipeline, only to be reassembled into intelligible messages at their destination. By agreeing to buy Ascend, Ciscos closest competitor in the data communications market, Lucent took a big step to beef up its Internet-based offerings. The real significance is that circuit-switching is a very limited technology and a proprietary technology, Donald J. Listwin, a Cisco executive vice president who manages the companys relationship with big communications carriers, said yesterday in an interview. This allows us to move voice over onto high-speed data infrastructures and its opening it up to offer competition and innovation.

Think of the Deerslayer, Davy Crockett, Amelia Earhart, Clint Eastwood. At times, though, the stereotype has failed to ring true; in truth, individualism has run in pronounced cycles. Just in the last 50 years, it was precisely the lack of individualism that prompted William H. Whytes Organization Man and David Riesmans Lonely Crowd, best sellers articulating public concern about the dangers of conformity. Americans, it was feared, had become too worried about fitting in, too afraid to be independent. Do not fold, spindle or mutilate, the instruction on computer punch cards, became a slogan against docile regimentation. Now, to judge by new evidence, the cycle has swung back again to individualism, indeed swung past self all the way to selfish. The evidence comes from a New York Times survey conducted for this special issue. The selfishness is not shameless; in fact, the public seems somewhat conflicted. People bemoan the self-centeredness they see around them. They regret that family ties are weakening. They complain that they cant trust most people. But at the same time, they express starkly individualistic views. When presented with"}

People bemoan the self-centeredness they see around them. They regret that family ties are weakening. They complain that they cant trust most people. But at the same time, they express starkly individualistic views. When presented with a list of basic values, they strongly identify with personal responsibility, self-sufficiency and self-expression. And not many see the contradiction -- that if everyone puts highest priority on ones own interests, then family and community ties may weaken further. The watchword has evolved from Rugged Individual to Im O.K., Youre Selfish. Individualism may feel like a natural condition, but many of its aspects did not develop until the last thousand years. Surnames, for example, did not emerge until the mid-1300s. Before then men typically were identified only by the names of their fathers -- John, son of Henry; Martin, Peters son -- and women took the names of their fathers or husbands. In eastern Europe, Jews typically did not have last names until the early 1800s, and in America, far into the 19th century, slaves were not permitted to have surnames unless given one by their owners.

Until then, to get from room A to room E, one had to walk through all the rooms in between. The newest aspect of individualism is that more people can aspire to it. A rising standard of living has freed most Americans from having to spend every waking hour satisfying basic needs. Middle-class affluence has also reduced the need to rely on parents or children and has enabled many more people to go it alone. A hundred years ago, few people lived by themselves; today 1 out of 4 households contains only one person. Meanwhile, the character of individualism has changed.

Meanwhile, the character of individualism has changed. The older style, echoing Franklin and Emerson, turned on self-reliance, achievement --what sociologists call utilitarian individualism. That is still much evident. But a newer style has blossomed in recent decades, what is called expressive individualism. That is about emotional gratification, self-help, getting in touch with feelings, expressing personal needs. Utilitarian individualism is going West, on Horace Greeleys advice, to find your fortune. Expressive individualism is going to the forest, on Robert Blys advice, to find your inner essence. Expressive individualism has flourished as prosperity has given more Americans the time and money to cultivate their own emotional gardens. It was not always so: if my grandparents had been asked about the importance of communicating their feelings, they might not have understood the question. They were too busy running a grocery store, raising 10 children and trying to survive the Great Depression.

The value rated as very important by the highest percentage of people was being responsible for your own actions. It is utilitarian individualism in its pure form. More than 95 percent call this very important, in every major category -- white, black and Hispanic; women and men, poor and rich, liberal and conservative. In fact, three of the four highest-rated values reflect personal responsibility and self-expression.

The difference is that being religious implies actively participating in worship, fellowship and other aspects of organized religious life. Most Americans dont think religious participation is as important as ones faith and moral code. Religion to me means belonging to a specific congregation or denomination, and that is not very important to me, says Beth Parth, a 42-year-old hair-salon owner from Empire, Mich. Faith means something I found myself, not something I learned in grade school or something someone told me I had. Its very much a personal thing.

This wariness of organized religion and lack of interpersonal trust could be taken as evidence of a broader change in Americans sense of self: declining involvement in civic groups, neighborhoods and communities. Alexis de Tocqueville thought that American democracy worked, in part, because of the many local citizens groups that could influence government and counter its power. But over the past few decades, membership in groups like the League of Women Voters and the Masons has plummeted. In their place, advocacy groups like the American Association of Retired Persons and the Childrens Defense Fund have proliferated.

The graduate students are pondering the rise of Mr. Riggio, a Brooklyn-bred entrepreneur, from bored student to chief executive of Barnes & Noble, the nations largest bookselling chain. And for their final exam this month, they will try to answer the very question that confronts the complex and restless Mr. Riggio: In an industry roiled by technological advances, with bookselling reduced to bits and bytes and two-day delivery and profits a distant concern for the companys most worrisome competitor, what exactly is Barnes & Nobles future?

For the first time in my lifetime, I cant see five years ahead the way I used to, Mr. Riggio said, both of the book business and retailing in general. I cant see it clearly. At 58, with salt-and-pepper hair and Brooklyn still in his voice, Mr. Riggio has presided over so many transformations in his 30 years of bookselling that it seems no surprise that he says one of his favorite books is The Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka. Mr. Riggio was largely responsible for the book industrys last metamorphosis -- the advent of the superstore, which in the 90s has come to dominate the literary landscape with airy temples of titles, comfortable chairs and the fragrance of espresso.

With his industrys future in flux, Mr. Riggio is hedging his bets, anticipating that customers will feel equally comfortable lingering in superstores to scan the latest hardcovers, or shopping for exotic titles on line or downloading a bestseller from a home computer into a 22-ounce electronic reader.

I came to it at first slowly, and then very, very quickly. Ultimately, he said, we jumped into the Internet business head first; we made big investments in capital, big investments in organization, big personal commitments to the business. Man of Metamorphoses His first transformation came almost 35 years ago, when, as a 24-year-old dropout, he invested $5,000 of borrowed money in a bookstore called Student Book Exchange near the N.Y.U. campus.

Not that Mr. Riggio has seen the film. Theres little spare time in his life for movies or the novel that hes been promising to write for some 10 years. He dutifully clears his schedule for his 15-year-old daughters basketball games, but his chip shot is languishing. Instead, his mind is on the hazy tomorrow. Its not just the changes in the book business, its the changes in retail, the changes in the way we live, Mr. Riggio said.

The gap between them is like everything that existed before and after the Internet, Mr. Riggio said; successful people will understand intuitively, he said, that the space is real and not imaginary, yet be able to walk through it, whole, on the other side. Skeptics may look at the strings and see just strings. But Mr. Riggio is trying to lead his company on both sides of the divide, steadily building new superstores into a chain that he expects could eventually number 1,000 (though the expansion has slowed to about 50 this year from about 90 a year) while investing heavily in the Internet.

The intent is to spend much of the proceeds to market the Web site, which had on-line sales of $70.2 million for the year, versus $610 million at Amazon.com and $4.6 million at Borders. (Barnes & Noble has a business tie to The New York Times, selling books through links from the newspapers Web site.) The trouble, of course, is that Amazon unabashedly declares that it loses money on every sale as it grabs market share from Barnes & Noble and other traditional bookstores. Some analysts estimate that by the end of this year, on-line sales will account for about 5 percent of the popular book market.

Barnes & Noble stock rose more than 20 percent on the news of the planned Internet spin-off, but at a Friday close of $36, the shares are still down 15 percent for the year. By comparison, Amazon, which closed the week at $190, is up 77 percent for the year.

He is reluctant to talk in any detail about Barnesandnoble.com because the company has entered the quiet period after the registration of its public offering.

Popular mathematics used to be an oxymoron, he said, but happily thats not true anymore. The celebrity, though, has its price.

Another favorite diversion is Goldbachs Conjecture, which holds that all even numbers are the sum of two primes. Though no one has found a counter example, this would-be theorem remains unproven, unless the solution has been crumpled up in a math department wastebasket somewhere.

The reason for imposing these restrictions was to see how much mathematics could be derived from two basic concepts, the line and the circle. Solving the three classic problems this way has been proved impossible. In 1882, for example, the German mathematician Ferdinand Lindemann established that trying to square the circle was hopeless. The reason is that pi, the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, is not only irrational (its infinitely long string of decimal places never repeats) but transcendental (it is not a solution of any polynomial equation with whole number coefficients). Amateur attempts at squaring the circle generally amount to rounding off pi to a close approximation like 22/7 or 355/113. At best the result is a square that is very close but never exactly the size of the circle. These people dont know what impossible means, Dr. Dudley lamented. They think it just means very hard.

They are operating in a conceptual vacuum. It leads to strange things. One of the rules mathematicians soon learn is never to answer a possible crank.

Cyberspace maps are being produced by geographers, cartographers, artists and computer scientists. They range from glorious depictions of globe-spanning communications networks to maps of Web information. Many have no geographic references, instead turning to nature, the cosmos or neuroscience for spatial models. They stretch the definition of a map in their effort to capture, sometimes fancifully, what is sometimes referred to as the common mental geography that lies beyond computer screens. The maps hold the potential to change, subtly or perhaps more directly, the relationship of the average person to cyberspace, the world of electronic communication that includes but is not limited to the Internet. How people envision the on-line landscape influences their behavior there, experts say. We need maps not just to navigate but to define and control new territory, said Martin Dodge, a researcher in the Center for Advanced Spatial Analysis at University College London.

We are in the very early stage of map making -- these maps are far from perfect at the moment, Mr. Dodge said. Most have been produced outside traditional cartography by people such as data visualization researchers who may not even call their results a map. Maps of cyberspace fall into two categories: those depicting the physical structure and information traffic patterns of global networks, and those addressing the content and social spaces of the electronic world. Structural maps, although seemingly straightforward, have proved quite thorny to create.

The Cooperative Association for Internet Data Analysis, or Caida, at the University of California at San Diego develops tools to collect and analyze data about the Net, like the specific paths a test packet of information may follow. We are not at a point yet where we are drawing maps with any compelling utility for any particular community, said K. C. Claffy, a researcher with the association, via E-mail.

Connectivity, not necessarily geography or distance, is the primary parameter of a cyberspace map, said Gregory C. Staple, president of Telegeography, a company in Washington that provides statistics and maps of the telecommunications industry. His company has produced maps of telecontinents, redrawing countries and coastlines to show how the flow of communications has created a new economic geography. At a glance, these maps reveal areas that are the telecommunications haves and have-nots, which Mr. Staple calls the deep-water ports and teledeserts of the information age (there are many more deserts than ports). Telegeography also offers maps of the Internet through its Peacock Maps subsidiary (peacockmaps.com).

They look something like promiscuously propagating sea ferns, with countless feathery vines. Are they useful? Although his maps may inspire awe because of their complexity, Mr. Cheswick explains that until such maps are interactive, allowing access to the database that created them, they are more powerful as symbols, perhaps, than as maps. Most so-called content maps are interactive and are focused on the portion of cyberspace now most populated: the Web.

In testimony that traced his 25 years in the business, Gordon E. Eubanks Jr. portrayed the software business as an entrepreneurial hotbed, fast changing and fluid, where todays dominant company can quickly become tomorrows also-ran. And Microsoft is under threat today, Mr. Eubanks said, because the center of gravity in computing is shifting rapidly beyond what he called the PC centric world ruled by Microsoft and its Windows operating system. The key, Mr. Eubanks told the court, is that software programmers are writing more and more programs to run on Internet technology, notably on browsing software, instead of on Windows.

But the technical and organizational challenges standing between that vision and AT&Ts present are so great that one AT&T executive likened AT&Ts ambitions to launching a space station.

And it is not clear if customers will end up footing the bill for AT&Ts plans, though AT&T is well aware that its pricing will have to undercut local telephone incumbents if it is to have much chance of success. Put simply, the main technical challenge for AT&T and for the customers it wants to serve is that AT&T is trying to get cable television networks to do things that they were never meant to. Traditional cable networks are well suited for their original job: transmitting television images. Cable networks have high capacities for information; a cable subscribers home is generally receiving every channel at once while the set-top box serves only as a filter to display one at a time. But traditional cable networks are built to transmit information in only one direction: from the company toward the user, and not the reverse.

But traditional cable networks are built to transmit information in only one direction: from the company toward the user, and not the reverse. That poses a problem for telephones, which inherently provide a two-way service. Traditional telephone networks are in some way the obverse of cable systems: they easily transmit communications in two directions, but they do not have to carry much information at the same time. Broken down into the ones and zeros of digital communications, a phone call is a subcompact beside the tractor-trailer of a single television channel. Think of the copper telephone wire as a very thin but very intelligent pipe, said Sender Cohen, a data communications analyst at Lehman Brothers, and the cable wire as very fat but very dumb. So AT&Ts first challenge is to make the cable systems it has agreed to acquire in some ways more like two-way telephone systems. That project, which requires the deployment of new equipment into cable hubs across the country, has already cost the cable industry billions of dollars, and in Mediaone, AT&T is set to acquire a cable operator with one of the most advanced networks"}

That project, which requires the deployment of new equipment into cable hubs across the country, has already cost the cable industry billions of dollars, and in Mediaone, AT&T is set to acquire a cable operator with one of the most advanced networks in the industry, but one that still requires upgrades. AT&T has also struck partnerships with the Comcast Corporation and Time Warner Inc., two big cable operators, to offer telephone service using those companies systems. But even once a cable system has been adapted to send and receive information, it is still not ready for the digital future. To offer high-speed Internet service, big investments must be made in high-speed Internet switches that can route millions, even billions of bits of digital information from one point to another every second. Even more daunting is the prospect of offering telephone service. Every house that intends to switch from conventional to cable-based phone service must be visited by a technician to install a box on the side of the house to connect the homes internal telephone wiring to the external cable wire.

Big telephone switches the size of a truck must be purchased and configured, almost by hand, to link with the cable network. Then there are a myriad of seemingly mundane concerns that nonetheless could be vital to consumers. For instance, allowing people to keep the same phone number when they switch to cable-based phone service can be quite complicated. Instead of a certain number routing to a Bell Atlantic phone switch, for instance, a call to that same number from across the country must now route seamlessly to an AT&T switch using a Mediaone cable network. Another challenge is that traditional cable systems generally use public power. When there is an electrical blackout, the cable television also fails. But the phone almost always works, even during a blackout. That is because telephone companies often generate their own power and because phone wires carry power as well as communications.

All of these technical challenges are just to offer phone service using conventional telephone technology, known as circuit switching, albeit over cable wires. To offer phone service over cable lines using Internet technology is even more complicated. In fact, the technology to do so reliably does not even exist yet. Mr. Armstrong said that he does not anticipate using Internet phone systems until 2001. The upshot for AT&T is that all of the billions of dollars and millions of hours it will spend on the technical challenges may pale beside the time, effort and money it will spend revamping its organization and deploying the anonymous back office computer systems that are the backbone of any modern business.

Time Warner was going to exchange its extensive Internet operations, including sites linked to its magazines, CNN and Warner Brothers entertainment properties, in return for a big stake in Alta Vista, the people said. The talks ended, among other reasons, because Time Warner was not willing to cede Compaq any control over its news and entertainment content, the executives said. Eckhard Pfeiffer, Compaqs chief executive, said in an interview yesterday that Compaq now wants to control its own Internet strategy.

Mr. Rosen offered his own detailed account of the disputed meeting and the events surrounding it. The meeting is a pivotal episode in the Governments suit. After Netscape declined Microsofts offer to divide the Internet browser market, the Government contends, Microsoft embarked on a pattern of anticompetitive behavior intended to thwart the challenge posed by Netscape.

The point is crucial because that meeting between Microsoft and Netscape is a key episode in the Governments antitrust case. With document after document supplementing his acerbic cross-examination, David Boies, the Justice Departments lead trial lawyer in the case against the Microsoft Corporation, proceeded today with perhaps the most sweeping attack on the credibility of a witness since the trial began last October. Again and again, he tried to point to contradictions between what Daniel Rosen, the witness, was saying today and what he and other Microsoft executives had written and said in the past.

And Mr. Rosen testified that his belief that Netscape did not intend to compete with Microsoft was based on what Netscape executives told him then. Mr. Rosen led a team from Microsoft that met with Netscape executives on June 21, 1995, when the Government contends that Microsoft threatened Netscape and made an illegal offer to divide the Internet browser market between them.

Microsoft, he added, was trying to persuade Netscape to adopt the underlying Internet technology it was building into its Windows 95 operating system, and then to build software products on top of Microsofts technology. Yet on May 15, 1995, more than a month before the disputed June meeting, Mr. Rosen wrote an E-mail titled Internet Direction in which he described the threat that Internet software posed to Microsofts control of the basic technology of personal computer software. Microsoft currently controls the base and evolution of the desktop platform, Mr. Rosen wrote. The threat of another company (Netscape has been mentioned by many) to use their Internet World Wide Web browser as an evolution base could threaten a considerable portion of Microsofts future revenue.

Asked about the Gates document, Mr. Rosen said, I recall when reading this I thought that Bill was probably wrong. A Microsoft spokesman, Mark Murray, said that the Governments efforts today did not show contradictions in Mr. Rosens testimony or that Microsoft was engaged in revisionist history to suit its defense.

Money was tight, particularly during the technology sector recession in the early 1990s.

It is now much easier for entrepeneurs to raise money. I recently founded my second Internet start-up. This time, I raised over $3 million in the first month. The Internet has also made business life a lot fairer. You dont have to stay in a big, bureaucratic company anymore; you can join a start-up.

The glut of money also has companies -- and the industry as a whole -- growing insanely fast, leading to labor shortages everywhere -- of not only engineers and managers, but graphic designers, accountants, headhunters, telephone system installers. Fortune seekers, many of them unqualified, flood to the Internet -- both to start companies and to work in them. This leads to sloppy work and some fairly sleazy behavior.

Such leaps are typical of the more than two dozen Internet-related companies that have completed initial offerings so far in 1999, and an improvement over the performance of similar offerings last year.

But few analysts can make sense of both Internet technology and the economic models that will lead to success on the new medium. David Readerman, a software and Internet analyst at Thomas Weisel Partners, a San Francisco investment bank, notes that while nearly every investment bank has at least two or three bankers working on Internet-related offerings, they have one securities analyst, at most, to follow the companies once the stock is trading. Analysts will play a far more important role in following Internet companies, Mr. Readerman said, than they did in, say, the biotechnology boom,. In the Food and Drug Administration, biotechnology companies had, an outsider to rule on their products ultimate success or failure. But determining the prospects of an Internet company is more prophesy and conjecture. People involved in bringing Internet companies to market also complain of a bottleneck at the Securities and Exchange Commission, which must review a companys disclosure documents before granting approval to sell shares.

Investment bankers say the initial review, which is supposed to be completed within 30 days, is taking closer to six weeks. Chris Ullman, an S.E.C. spokesman, denied that backlog; he said that while the average time for review of a filing for initial public offerings had recently been 31 to 33 days, it has now returned to 30 days. In Silicon Valley there is talk that the fastest way to get an Internet business to market is to pretend its not an Internet company. When companies register with the S.E.C., the documents are initially routed within the agency to industry experts based on the companys Standard Industrial Classification code, a four-digit number indicating the industry in which the company does business. Investment bankers and other Wall Street professionals say that companies have recently been tweaking their industry codes to avoid the queues numbered in the 7370s, which denotes computer systems and software.

That queue has been used by a wide variety of companies, including Priceline.com, which sells discounted airline tickets over the Internet. But two other companies in a similar business -- Lowestfare.com and Cheap Tickets Inc. -- used the codes for transportation services and general business services, respectively. Mr. Ullman said that whatever code a company initially files under, the S.E.C. will determine the correct industry and route the filing accordingly. In other words, he advised companies, dont try it. Companies still cannot get their offerings to the market quickly enough, in part because they fear missing the opportunity before the financing window closes. Investment managers, on the other hand, cannot seem to buy quickly enough, showing little regard for the outsized valuations at which Internet companies are going public.

Shirk 3d, managing editor of the New Issues newsletter, said his publication has recommended that investors flip, or sell on the first day of trading, nearly every Internet I.P.O. that has come to market this year -- provided that an investor can get shares at the initial offering price, as institutions can but individuals usually cannot. Were not seeing a lot that we would recommend for a long-term investor, he said, particularly after trading begins and the stock has already more than doubled. Though individual investors may be left out of the earliest part of the game, institutions are jumping into deals that, in the not-so-distant past, would have drawn little enthusiasm.

Demand by institutional investors has gotten much higher because those managers want to show these stocks in their portfolios at the end of each quarter, said Linda Killian, who herself manages a mutual fund that invests in new offerings, the IPO Plus Aftermarket fund. Whether the quality of the companies coming public has deteriorated is a matter of opinion. A decade ago, only rarely could a company go public without a record of sales growth from three to five years and at least some profits. In 1997, though, about a third of the companies completing initial offerings were losing money, Ms. Killian said. Today, a similar portion have virtually no sales. So if you are simplistic about it and look at traditional measures, youd have to say that the quality has plunged, she said. But if you look at it in a different way, maybe not.

You probably expect me to throw in a picture of John and Yoko staging their bed-in for peace or of Yippies trying to levitate the Pentagon. But in fact I make this nomination in a post-ironic spirit. I think what will amaze people in 3000 A.D. about peace symbols is not their idealism but the fact that they were ever considered idealistic. The end of war between nations is a nearly certain achievement of the next millennium, if not the next century. The last time this sort of optimism was fashionable was during the giddy aftermath of the cold war, a decade ago. Since then, of course, weve been sobered up, grimly reminded that bonds of ethnicity and nationality are lethal. Conflicts in the Balkans, the Caucasus, Africa and so on are now taken as proof that a global village doesnt bring peace, that one-worldishness is just as nave in 1999 as it was in 1969 or"}

Conflicts in the Balkans, the Caucasus, Africa and so on are now taken as proof that a global village doesnt bring peace, that one-worldishness is just as nave in 1999 as it was in 1969 or 1989. But in truth these examples illustrate the opposite. To see what I mean, you have to first see that the link between the global village and world peace is not the one that John and Yoko might have envisioned: that global communication automatically brings mutual understanding, hence peace. If things were that simple, we wouldnt have many wars to begin with. Fighting is typically preceded by talking, after all. No, another ingredient besides communication is necessary. The people doing the communicating have to have a strong interest in peace and understanding to begin with. The key thing about the information technology now enveloping the world is the way it strengthens that interest. All those optical fibers are helping create a fine-grained economic interdependence among states.

This interdependence makes war less and less a zero-sum game, with a winner and a loser, and more and more a non-zero-sum game -- specifically, a lose-lose, or negative-sum, game: a game you win by not playing. Fortunately for world peace, rising interdependence is a basic property of history. Civilizations rise and fall, dark ages come and go, but in the long run, technological evolution moves in only one direction. From cuneiform to computer, from camel to Concorde, the division of economic labor gets more elaborate and more far-flung; people, and peoples, need one another more. Today, in the highly globalized capitalist states on the edge of this trend, interdependence is felt more broadly than ever, by armies of businesspeople who communicate with their counterparts in other cultures. In some cases, hard economic interest even leads to a softer, John-and-Yokoish antiwar force: friendship. In this light, trouble spots in the"}

After all, these places are underglobalized. Sure, they have Nikes and Coca-Cola, but they havent been intricately, organically penetrated by modern capitalism. Even the more economically advanced of these areas, in the former Yugoslavia, missed much of the Industrial Revolution and then spent much of this century under a mild but still retarding form of Communism. And, anyway, note how much of the recent conflict is traceable to the end of the cold war, which for half a century kept artificial state borders intact around the world. Some transitional reordering is not surprising, and theres probably more to come. But the cold war can end only once. When the dust settles, borders will be more rational, and the logic behind peace will keep growing."}

Bezos, founder and chairman of the Internets retail whale, Amazon.com, made a simple observation that should have signaled problems ahead for technology companies that assumed that the information age would be business as usual. I hear a lot of people talking about business models, but I dont hear much about customer value, Mr. Bezos said. If value was indeed going to be the key, a lot of business models were going to have to change -- most notably the telecommunications industrys, on which the Internet was being built. But instead of clanging like a gong in the heads of telecommunications executives, the cautionary logic of those words apparently continues to fall on deaf ears. Few industries have gorged themselves on digital commerce with greater appetite than the telecommunications companies. But the result has been a wired world that to many customers seems like a cross between the best-known works of Edvard Munch and Jean-Paul Sartre: we scream, but there is no exit.

Telephone services provide a sharp and unfortunate contrast to on-line retailers like Mr. Bezos, who realized early on that keeping customers is a lot easier than losing them to substandard service and continually enticing new ones into the fold. It is a rare consumer today who has only one horror story to tell. Some engage in regular battle with cellular telephone duopolies and their arcane and incomprehensible pricing structures, which sometimes even charge for calls that their own networks are incapable of delivering. Others are continually confronted with pager services with sporadic delivery that charge by the alpha-numeric character and employ operators who apparently have no schooling in even the basics of abbreviation. Still others are engaged in conflicts -- which now involve the Federal Communications Commission -- over so-called casual customer rates for long-distance calls, socking consumers with the functional equivalent of $28 for a $1 gallon of gasoline.

What is more, the telephone is the most common bridge to cyberspace, and as Internet and other on-line service providers reach a broader and less sophisticated market, the Internet revolution is in danger of becoming a latter-day Boston Tea Party as customer complaints mount about responsiveness and overcharging. Customer satisfaction rates for companies that were once blue chips in the telephone industry are sinking, said Nick Donatiello, president of the consumer research firm Odyssey L.P. AT&Ts image, for example, has rebounded somewhat, but it had been declining steadily for the past few years, Mr. Donatiello said. The phone giant was rated very good by 63 percent of United States households in 1994 but dropped sharply, to 37 percent, in 1997 in Odysseys surveys before rebounding to 55 percent last year. Still, its not nearly what it was, he added. Why are these companies, so central to the continued growth of the digital universe, so apparently intractable about providing value to customers?

Why are these companies, so central to the continued growth of the digital universe, so apparently intractable about providing value to customers? The problem, Mr. Donatiello said, is that virtually everyone in the telecom industry has had the luxury of treating their customers like garbage for a very long time, first because they had a monopoly -- and some still do -- while others have geographic oligopolies. As a result, he says, they are in a position not to care very much whether customers are satisfied with the quality or value of the services they sign up for. One of the most profound differences between on-line retail and the business of providing telecommunications, for example, is that customers find it a simple task to compare the prices of a book from several vendors. In contrast, telecommunications providers -- cellular and long-distance, especially -- seem to take pride in making it almost impossible to do so, with complex rates that vary by day of week, time of day and sometimes, it seems, the phases of the moon.

Americans dont like to have the meter running on anything that has to do with entertainment, information or communication, he said. Thats why we saw such a huge uptick in the adoption curve of on-line services when America Online went to its flat-rate model, now $21.95 a month. The single-price model may also account for the popularity of AT&Ts Digital One plan, which offers customers in certain cities a flat rate of $90 a month for 600 minutes of cellular calls to or from anywhere in the United States. The popularity of that plan, in turn, is setting off a frenzy among other wireless providers to offer their own flat-rate plans. But consumer attitudes suggest that may not be enough.

Increasingly, people want to simplify the enormous complexity of their wired lives by buying all their telecommunications-- local phone service, long distance, cellular, cable television and Internet connections -- from a single provider. And though AT&T again says it is leading the charge with its purchase of the cable television giant Tele-Communications Inc., Mr. Donatiello says consumers apparently do not hold out much hope that even moves this bold will make their lives easier to understand or manage. The bottom line is that consumers dont think any kind of company would do a good job providing a full range of services, he said. Their No. 1 choice was a long-distance company, and only 37 percent of U.S. households said they would do a good job.
