Tech companies say it is - and journalists are worried", "author": "The Toronto Star", "chunk": "On Nov. 30, 2022, San-Francisco-based OpenAI released ChatGPT , a chatbot capable of generating text almost indistinguishable from that written by a human. It wasnt perfect - the bot had a tendency to \"hallucinate facts\" - but still prompted journalists to wonder whether the bot might eventually take their jobs. At least journalists could take comfort in the fact that they had something ChatGPT didnt: currency. Back in 2022, the AI chatbot couldnt access real-time information, having only been trained on information up until September 2021. That all changed in September 2023, when OpenAI announced that the chatbot was now up to date. Users could ask the bot questions about current affairs. Later that year, the New York Times sued OpenAI and Microsoft, alleging in a court filing that the tech companies had unlawfully used the Times copyrighted articles to train its software. Microsoft and OpenAI sought to \"free-ride on the Times massive investment in its journalism ... without permission or payment,\" reads the complaint. The lawsuit added an additional layer of complexity to the discussion surrounding journalism and AI: the technology posed a threat not only to individual journalists and their livelihoods, but also"}

The lawsuit added an additional layer of complexity to the discussion surrounding journalism and AI: the technology posed a threat not only to individual journalists and their livelihoods, but also to the field itself, by providing access to hard-won articles for free. The chatbots outputs were \"similar, but not identical\" to Times articles, responded OpenAI in a motion. \"Contrary to the allegations in the Complaint, ChatGPT is not in any way a substitute for a subscription to the New York Times,\" the motion notes. \"One cannot use ChatGPT to serve up Times articles at will.\" The motion added that it is \"perfectly lawful to use copyrighted content as part of a technological process that (as here) results in the creation of new, different and innovative products.\" Journalism advocates are not convinced.

Legislators need to step up, Radsch said, otherwise journalism s business model - and subsequently democracy - will be at risk. Whats the problem? Artificial intelligence systems are built on the theft of intellectual property from publishers - from the news sector. Journalism is a core and fundamentally important part of the training sets and models that underlie AI systems. It is essential to make AI applications like search, chatbots and other sorts of products and services that rely on contextually accurate, timely, relevant information. And yet (large tech companies) are building their products and services on a model of theft.

If you dont include news and quality information in AI systems, if theyre trained on too much synthetic data, the systems will degrade and potentially collapse. And they will regurgitate problematic information. How does this trend affect the average consumer? The average consumer relies on journalism for a wide variety of things.

AI has been in newsrooms for a long time. Newsrooms and journalists have been using AI to help with translation and transcription. Theres all sorts of potential for AI in terms of investigative work such as information analysis and retrieval. But I think that integrating generative AI into the newsroom in ways that replace human creativity or human ingenuity and intelligence is problematic.

Just playing devils advocate here: Why is it so bad if journalism jobs are replaced by AI? AI is based on prediction ; it enforces a mediocrity and genericness because, again, its the prediction of what is most likely to occur in that string of text, or that relationship between an image and a word. I get concerned about what thats going to do in terms of outputs ... cutting off the outer edges, the extremes. Youre going to see this vast middling of human creativity. If youre creating an AI, (you need to ask:) who gets published? Which ideas get published? Its overwhelmingly white, overwhelmingly male.

At the same time, there are huge opportunities to do investigations and collaborations and make sense of and discover things in data, and I think thats really interesting. I dont think that journalism has the option to just opt out, although I think there will be news outlets and journalists that decide: our value proposition, our uniqueness, is going to be that we are human-first, human-centred, human-only.

It has forced companies that have created algorithms based on ill-gotten data or privacy-violating data to destroy the algorithms built on that data. We should absolutely be doing the same thing for these large language models , because theyre not safe and are incredibly disruptive, and there are no safeguards and no constraints.

Journalism is a core and fundamentally important part of the training sets and models that underlie AI systems. It is essential to make AI applications like search, chatbots and other sorts of products and services that rely on contextually accurate, timely, relevant information. And yet (large tech companies) are building their products and services on a model of theft. They are creating value to their investors, creating their product using journalism , and yet they have not paid license, they have not received permission, and we know that this information is being taken from news outlets and journalists , even when"}

Theres all sorts of potential for AI in terms of investigative work such as information analysis and retrieval. But I think that integrating generative AI into the newsroom in ways that replace human creativity or human ingenuity and intelligence is problematic. The problem is that these companies are creating partnerships with news organizations to integrate their tools into the newsroom.

Its little more than an inconvenient question from poor artists and beset news organizations. Eric Schmidt, the former Google chief executive and chairman, recently gave students at Stanford University an idea of how big-tech billionaires think: \"If TikTok is banned, heres what I propose each and every one of you do. Say to your LLM the following: Make me a copy of TikTok, steal all the users, steal all the music, put my preferences in it, produce this program in the next 30 seconds, release it, and in one hour, if its not viral, do something different along the same lines.

Others have insisted that Google, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft and others arent stealing this material at all; its simply fair use (or in Canada, \"fair dealing\"). Thats preposterous. What exactly is fair use? As any author or book publisher knows, limited, careful use of copyrighted material for education, criticism and more is a grey area. At the moment, quoting with attribution one hundred words in a 100,000-word book might be considered fair use; but then again, it doesnt mean you cant be sued for copyright infringement. For example, I wanted to use 200 words from the famous \"blue sweater\" scene in the movie \"The Devil Wears Prada\" for my book \"Shopomania,\" but I wasnt about to irk the giant Disney corporation without checking with it first. Its quite clear that LLMs are slurping up more - a lot more - than just that."}

Huge power imbalance Because the decline in the news industry has been so gradual, it can be hard to appreciate just how much money has fled the industry over the past decade. Hundreds of millions of dollars have vanished from the books of major publishers and networks. They have had to cut costs, and reduce quality, to survive. Many have folded anyway. According to the Local News Research Project, more than 400 local news outlets have closed across the country since 2014.

Two-thousand eighteen was the worst year for news outlet closures in this countrys history. St-Onge, who spent 15 years on the operations side of La Presse, has had a front-row seat to all of this.

The governments plan to rectify this \"huge power imbalance,\" in St-Onges words, was the Online News Act. The law, passed by Parliament last year, ordered the biggest internet companies to strike financial deals with Canadian media outlets. Meta protested the act, banning all news for Canadian users on Facebook and Instagram. Google played ball, inking a deal to distribute $100 million per year to Canadian publishers. To dole out the money, Google selected the Canadian Journalism Collective, a ragtag bunch of small, left-wing and independent local news outlets. It was an odd choice. The collective has struggled to create the structure necessary to disburse the cash.

The collective may eventually fix these problems. But we are wasting precious time and energy fighting the wrong battles. Read the fine print While Ottawa framed the Online News Act as a challenge to the big tech companies, it may turn out to be more of a gift.

He envisioned a country that would stretch beyond the united colonies of Upper and Lower Canada (present-day Ontario and Quebec) and Atlantic Canada to include the vast lands to their north and west. To spread this message, he turned to new technologies that were revolutionizing Victorian society. About two months after publishing The Globes first edition using a hand press that printed 200 copies an hour, Brown travelled to New York. There, he bought a rotary press from famed inventor Richard March Hoe that could produce 1,250 copies an hour. The state-of-the-art press transformed The Globes reach, allowing the weekly to start publishing twice every week by 1846, and daily by 1853. But he didnt stop there.

Brown later secured access to a second line from Montreal. Brown also took advantage of improved roads and the new railway to deliver the paper into the southwestern communities that had then represented the limit of colonial settlement in Upper Canada. His obsession with technology made perfect sense. Canada, even before Confederation, was such a large land and so thinly populated that any newspaper seeking to be national in scope needed to grasp any invention that solved the problems of distance and time. All of this was expensive, but the investments paid off.

Brown established a template that future publishers have followed: Exploit new technology to establish and expand The Globes reach across the nation and around the world. More than once, this formula saved the paper. Over the years, The Globe has celebrated several technological feats. The newspaper brought readers the first photograph wired to Canada on Dec. 9, 1936.

The Globe was shipping its six national editions across the country by air or post, which was costly and inefficient. Editors had to manually lay out, proof and adjust pages with new stories for each edition \u2013 an old-school approach that Megarry found infuriating. More significantly, The Globes circulation was flatlining at around 300,000. It faced stiff competition in its primary market of Toronto; 60 per cent of the papers readers in the city also read the Toronto Star, which had lower ad rates and a much higher daily circulation of 500,000.

Canada gained a new Nobel laureate when Hinton got the call from Stockholm early Tuesday morning in what he described as a cheap hotel in California. He was co-awarded the prize with Princeton University researcher John Hopfield, who also made foundational breakthroughs; the two will split the prize of 11 million Swedish kronor (about $1.45 million Canadian dollars) equally, with Hinton telling reporters he plans to donate his winnings to causes such as creating employment opportunities for neurodiverse young adults. \"Im flabbergasted,\" Hinton said.

In the 1970s, portable calculators transformed our ability to do math. Today, generative chatbots such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Gemini are driving similar changes in our professional and personal work. Unlike calculators, chatbots can produce incorrect or fabricated responses, known as hallucinations. When humans and organizations uncritically use this untruthful chatbot content for tasks, it becomes what collaborators and I call \u201cbotshit.\u201d [ This content is a risk, because the large language models that underlie how chatbots work generate responses by predicting patterns of words that seem useful based on their training data.

These examples clearly highlight the hazards of uncritically using chatbots to generate content for different types of work. To learn to effectively use chatbots we need to understand and mitigate the epistemic risks associated with this untruthful content. This involves chatbot users considering two questions when using the technology for work: How important is chatbot response veracity for the task? And how easy is it to verify the veracity of the chatbot response? The answers to these two questions lead to four different modes of chatbot work: authenticated, autonomous, automated and augmented.

This can sometimes be done with the truth, but often its done with fiction. The easiest example comes from religion, where mythological stories about things that didnt really happen, about entities that dont really exist, are nevertheless very effective in connecting millions and billions of people. Money is probably the most successful fiction ever created. It has no value in itself.

One reason AI-based advice will not dominate advisor guidance is due to the human coder\u2019s imprint on AI tools . Algorithms are created by human programmers, and people cannot avoid imparting their own biases into the code they write.

Critics say its a textbook political manoeuvre by tech giants to avoid a fee under what could have been groundbreaking legislation. California lawmakers agreed to kill a bill requiring tech to support news outlets they profit from in exchange for Googles financial commitment.

Dr. Hintons co-winner, Dr. Hopfield, was born in Chicago in 1933 and received his PhD from Cornell University in 1958. After making important contributions to solid state physics and to the study of biochemical reactions, Dr. Hopfield became interested in the questions related to neuroscience, including how neurons in the brain act together to store and retrieve information. This led him to discover a computerbased analogue known as a Hopfield network, which allows a machine to retrieve a stored pattern that is most similar to a given input. His work was published in 1982 in what is now considered a landmark paper in the field. Soon after, Dr. Hinton made use of Hopfield networks when developing a data-recognition algorithm. Using methods drawn from statistical physics, he and Terrence Sejnowski of Johns Hopkins University came up with a method in which a category of network called a Boltzmann machine could be trained to classify an image or"}

Dr. Hinton then continued to explore networks constructed in layers that could break down a task such as image or language recognition into bitesized pieces that together led to an answer that the system calculated was most likely to be correct. A key feature of this work was the use of a technique called back-propagation by Dr. Hinton and his collaborators, including U.S. psychologist and computer scientist David Rumelhart. This method amounts to feeding the network information about its own accuracy so that it can adjust how much weight to give to each of its subcomponents, or nodes, to keep improving through experience.

Recently there has also been a proliferation in the use of AI image generators to negatively depict Jewish people in relation to the war in Gaza, said Siegel. Muslim communities have also been rocked by anti-Islamic sentiment since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack, but it is antisemitism that has been the focus of hate-filled, far-right groups using AI tools , according to Memetica, a threat analysis company that monitors online hate."}

With most Holocaust survivors now in their 90s, archivists, historians and museums are turning to immersive technologies to preserve their stories for future generations. For instance, Torontos Holocaust Museum and the National Holocaust Monument in Ottawa are leveraging technology to customize first-person accounts, artifacts, photos and documents and to offer virtual reality experiences.

And leaders of these projects as well as technology experts told the Star that while more protective measures are still needed, the benefits of using AI to preserve history still far exceed its dangers. Survivors themselves seem to have little fear about embracing technology to preserve their memories. The USC Shoah Foundation has collected 56,000 audio-visual Holocaust testimonies in 44 languages from 65 countries. Building on this success, the foundation has now expanded its reach to educate on the horrors of other genocides by collecting testimonies from survivors and witnesses of the Armenian genocide during the First World War, the 1937 Nanjing Massacre in China, the Cambodian genocide of the 1970s, the Guatemalan genocide of the early 1980s, the 1994 genocide against the Tutsis in Rwanda, the ongoing South Sudan civil war, the Central African Republic conflict of 2012 and anti-Rohingya"}

As a communicator, I depend on traditional media being there as one of the tools to get messages to audiences. Looking back over the year, there were important lessons in the broadcast and print headlines that dominated the news cycle. As I strap on my seatbelt for another bumpy ride, I look back at the headlines of 2024: 1.

But thats not what we talked about. Storytellers must ensure the message is empathic, acknowledges the daily hardships many are experiencing and is easily understood. A solid jargon filter will be mandatory. 3. The storm brewing: 2024 was marked by extreme weather, including record-breaking heatwaves, devastating wildfires, costly hail storms and flooding. Although weather stories dominate the headlines, media are sensitive to the fact that people grow weary of them, so they move on, leaving critical, on-the-ground communications to others.

Although most people now connect to the internet \u2013 and many AI applications \u2013 by phone rather than computer, its a symbolic kickoff to whats expected to be a competitive year as tech companies race to outdo each other in AI applications even as they havent yet resolved all the ethical and legal ramifications. The New York Times last month sued both OpenAI and Microsoft alleging that tools such as ChatGPT and Copilot \u2013 formerly known as Bing Chat \u2013 are infringing on copyrighted news articles.

There were publishers large and small from across Canada and experts from abroad, such as Ricky Sutton from Australia and Stephen Waldman from the United States. Like many local newspapers , the Crowsnest Pass Herald has been around for a long time. It was founded in 1930. My mom worked there and eventually became a coowner in 1969. Ive worked there since university and am now the sole owner. As a small entrepreneur, in any given week, I write copy, sell ads and even deliver newspapers . Over the years, Ive learned a few things along the way. First, Big Tech is destroying local media. In 2014, we started doing ads with Google, which I thought was going to be a game- changer . The good news was that Google ads started popping up all over the place; the bad news was that I received a mere 17 cents from Google. Half our revenue used to come from big national brands such as Ford, General Motors and Dodge. They were doing full-page ads, and things were"}

Half our revenue used to come from big national brands such as Ford, General Motors and Dodge. They were doing full-page ads, and things were great. We had a thriving business, but as Google and Meta got into the advertising game, I watched our national advertising shrink dramatically. To put that in perspective, since 1999, my gross revenue has dropped by two-thirds, which is tough when youre just trying to meet payroll. Thats why I am the lead on an $8-billion class-action lawsuit. Second, publishers are stronger when we stick together. While I was furious when most of the large news publishers cut their own one-off content licensing deals with Google and Meta, I was encouraged that they pushed for what became the Online News Act to ensure Big Tech pays not only the big guys, but also community publishers such as myself.

Third, in the absence of the U.S. Department of Justice breaking up Googles monopoly in ad tech, publishers around the world are going to continue to need some level of government support. On this point, Im encouraged by the words of now U.S. vice-president-elect JD Vance, who posted the following on X: \"Long overdue, but its time to break Google up.\" Fourth, when it comes to government support, we need to make sure that government supports dont advantage one type of publisher over another. For example, there are some who say the only solution is tax credits for readers. Such a credit already exists - albeit not a very generous one. One digitally savvy publisher told the Neiman Lab at Harvard that the result was \"negligible.\" Like all tax credits, a subscription tax credit, irrespective of its design, is limited in its ability to create demand given that many Canadians are not prepared to pay a subscription fee for news content even if a future partial reimbursement (lumped into their tax return) is foreseeable.

Anecdotally, it is no wonder that one can regularly find the big guys in the market with incredibly discounted subscription plans. Their marketing executives are reading the same data and concluding that most new subscribers are only willing to pay a few bucks a month. There is no question that a richer digital subscription tax credit would be a nice boutique tax break for the Starbucks-sipping Laurentian elites who are already subscribing to several newspapers . However, it would do nothing for the hundreds of weekly community newspapers across Canada. Local news , in my opinion, is not some luxury good for the privileged few. Heck, we dont even have a Starbucks in Crowsnest Pass, Alta. Fifth, the best supports are those that incent the right behaviours and outcomes.

Ontario Premier Doug Ford has committed 25 per cent of the provinces advertising budget to support news , and we need others to do the same. To governments and corporate advertisers, if you want to reach the 5,600 good people of Crowsnest Pass and keep your money in Canada rather than seeing it flow to California, give me a holler.

Its 12 main recommendations aim to ensure the responsible and ethical development and use of AI in the province. As AI use spreads, more experts are sounding the alarm to highlight the risks associated with an uncontrolled development of the technology.

But many site owners say they cant afford to block Googles AI from summarizing their content. Thats because the Google tool that sifts through web content to come up with its AI answers is the same one that keeps track of web pages for search results, according to publishers. Blocking Alphabet Inc.s Google the way sites have blocked some of its AI competitors would also hamper a sites ability to be discovered online. Googles dominance in search - which a U.S. federal court ruled recently is an illegal monopoly - is giving it a decisive advantage in the brewing AI wars, which search startups and publishers say is unfair as the industry takes shape.

The rise of generative AI has touched off a new wave of startups seeking to offer search products in which AI models deliver succinct answers to users questions. The chatbots popularity has sparked a panic within Google about the future of its search engine, which for so long seemed invincible.

Earlier this year, Google rolled out AI Overviews, in which the company uses AI to give succinct answers to some of users questions at the top of the search page. Publishers were immediately concerned about the impact the answers could have on their traffic but had no clear way to address those fears. Google uses a separate crawler for some AI products, such as its chatbot Gemini. But its main crawler, the Googlebot, serves both AI Overviews and Google search. A company spokesperson said Googlebot governs AI Overviews because AI and the companys search engine are deeply entwined.

Profit-seeking artificial intelligence chatbots and environmentally harmful cryptocurrencies? Social media platforms cluttered with ads and banning news content for Canadians? I doubt it. This year marks the 30th anniversary of the World Wide Web, or at least the version of the internet as we know it today. In 1994, when the first web browser debuted, tech evangelists were effusive with dreams of the technological future as a place of free information, expression and opportunity. However, as we know, the internet quickly became more privatized, more extractive and less wondrous. This is an opportune moment, then, to reconsider the past 30 years and take stock of what went wrong. The first problem may be that our tech leaders - from Mark Zuckerberg to OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman - seem to think they can force their latest fixations on the rest of us with impunity. Zuckerbergs mission to turn Facebook into Meta and embrace the metaverse, inspired by Neal Stephensons dystopian 1992 novel Snow Crash, stirred much investment, even though one wonders whether anyone actually seems excited about it."}

The way I see it, this hubris among our corporate leaders is merely a symptom of a much larger problem, which is that the future has become the domain not of governments, organizations or citizens, but of technology and, more to the point, the companies and executives that wield it. The risk is that the whims of Zuckerberg, Altman, Elon Musk and other \"great male geniuses\" of Silicon Valley come to decide what the rest of us deal with, and what seems imaginable, thereby shaping and limiting our own imaginations.

The narratives of the future sold by todays Big Tech have shaped the discourse for us all. I call these \"unwanted utopias\" - terrific for the Zuckerbergs and Musks of the world, but not very utopian for you and me. So what do we do now? First, we must recognize that what a technology can do is less important than the ways in which it is actually used. This, I believe, should be our guiding principle as the internet enters its fourth decade. We must ask ourselves whether the future that is being sold to us has our interests in mind.

Third, we must realize that any story is fallible. As many of these companies are now facing a new reality where constant growth seems more difficult, their promises begin to look less appealing, less trustworthy. Maybe thats because they are. Of course, considering how the internet has evolved, and how entrenched in its ways it has become, its hard to imagine how we can reclaim the future from Big Techs elite and recover the opportunities it initially presented in 1994.

Turning a Bit More Positive on Bonds Too As for the bond market implications, this is a wash: higher productivity growth ipso facto means a higher real interest rate, but it also means lower inflation expectations .

Its the largest financial commitment the country has ever dedicated to AI, a technology Canada is trying to pioneer, harness and regulate all at the same time.

It begins in 1966 with a fumble by a rival, a snatch, and a heroic run. The CBC, in 1966, had just cancelled a groundbreaking and saucy weekly current affair show \"This Hour Has Seven Days.\" It poked the powerful, bent traditional storytelling, and earned plenty of enemies - too many for the management of CBC News at the time to withstand, so they canned it. CTV National News was then in its infancy, and just as plucky. It saw the opportunity CBC had provided and launched a similar hard-nosed investigative show called \"W5,\" even though the privately-owned network was in desperate financial shape at the time, verging on bankruptcy. Scrub through 58 more seasons of \"W5,\" and you land on its final episode which airs this weekend.

Instead, AI will likely complement the work of judges, making them more productive but not replacing them.

That in itself brings up questions for the medical establishment as to whether they would like to expand the number of doctors to make sure that AI is not used in isolation. Rising income disparities as a result of AI adoption are a real concern. The IMF paper points out that in virtually every country they looked at, whether high or low income, the same groups of workers are set up to lose ground.

Players could trade real-world money for Robux, which they would then spend on accessories - shirts, hats and special weapons - for their online avatars or on special powers that fast-tracked their in-game progress. A portion of those Robux would go to the games creator. And if a creator accumulated enough Robux, they could cash them back out - about 60 Robux per Canadian dollar.

Only a small number of them attract a player base substantial enough to earn that many Robux. \"You can have the most fascinating, well-crafted world, but if you dont know how to advertise and communicate with the community, its going to fail,\" said Bronson Boualavong, a 26year-old independent Roblox developer in Hamilton, Ont. \"There are people who get lucky and end up making a million Robux a month, and theyre making more money than their parents. But thats like winning the lottery.\" Boualavong, like Field-Draper, belongs to a new class of online creatives, not unlike the legions of professional YouTubers, the influencers who make their living on Instagram, and the people who get paid to post TikToks. Like those platforms, Roblox relies primarily on its community of users"}

Like those platforms, Roblox relies primarily on its community of users to create its content. But what sets Roblox apart is that the vast majority of its users are minors. According to Roblox Corporation, 60 per cent of its 70 million active daily users are under the age of 16. This has stoked a fierce debate. Is Roblox teaching young people valuable STEM skills, fostering entrepreneurship and remunerating kids for playing a game they love? Or is Roblox, a company worth US$30 billion, luring kids with the illusion of riches and leaning on their labour to prop up its bottom"}

Or is Roblox, a company worth US$30 billion, luring kids with the illusion of riches and leaning on their labour to prop up its bottom line? If youre over the age of 30, youve probably never played (or even heard of) Roblox. But if you have kids, its likely part of your daily life. In 2020, Roblox Corporation said that half of American children had tried it, and its likely that a similar proportion of Canadian kids have tried it, too. In fact, the company says it combines Canadians and Americans in its demographic statistics. Roblox is one of the most accessible video games in the world. Kids can download it for free from app stores on their phones, tablets, computers, Xboxes and PlayStations."}

He then told these leaders, who were gathered in a country that criminalizes being gay, what he would do if he were a leader of a developing nation: \u201cThe first thing that I would do, of course, is I would codify the language, the data of your culture into your own large language model.\u201d Did leaders of authoritarian nations lean forward in their seats?

That\u2019s not to mention the risk of fuelling an already dominant Nvidia into a force that could squeeze out competition completely. How does all this square with \u201cdemocratizing\u201d access to artificial intelligence ? And more to Huang\u2019s point: are there lines he wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable seeing crossed? In July, the Digital Forensic Research Lab outlined ways [ use it to further erode human rights.
